>  Their sock drawers.

Yes, the whole drawer.

>  All the insoles from their left shoes.

>  The charger, we all know they are just going to blame the rest of the family

>  The elasticity of all their underwear

>  All of their toilet seats.

>  The rubber bits on the end of their earphones

>  You know those u-bend pipe things that connect sinks to the rest of the house’s plumbing? The part that’s usually removable so that you can clear blockages out of the pipes right beneath the sink? Yeah, I’d take all of those.

>  Their Tupperware lids

Edit: wow, didn't know I'd get so many upvotes for this, thanks y'all

>  That button on their TV remote to change the channel forward.

Yes, only that one.

>  The bottom hinge of every door, or their toilet paper.

>  Literally all the handles I can find.

>  [one wheel of the chair](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IIDiMEsX2VVYH_S35LyeVg/348s.jpg), so they now have to sit in a weird angle and sometimes have a panic rush when they lean over to the side and think they are going to fall

>  The matt to stop the floor getting wet next to the shower.

>  One corn holder, so there will always be an odd number in the drawer.

>  Tire valves

>  Salt and pepper

>  Fingernail clippers...  you only need them like once every 4 weeks, but you're never gonna remember to buy a new pair until you need stitches from accidentally cutting yourself.

Additional information: I've never timed my nail clippings; 4 weeks was a bit of a guess, but I'd definitely say I don't keep them long.  Just long enough to crack open a can but short enough not to break.

>  All of the extension cords

>  You know that little lid that holds all your dish soap in the dishwasher? Yeah, that's mine now.

>  All of their left shoes

Edit: Wait no, just one of their left shoes. That way they won't think they've been robbed and will spend countless hours trying to find a shoe that isn't there

>  * Nearly all the mayonnaise out of the mayonnaise jar, so their next sandwich involves five minutes of scraping about.
* Most of the toothpaste from the tube in their bathroom.
* A single button off most of their shirts.
* All their extra batteries.
* Find the drawer were they keep the good lube and the emergency backup dollar store lube. Take the backup lube—one day a few weeks from now they'll be getting ready for a sex act and they'll find out they only have a tiny, insufficient dab of the good lube left and realize they're done for the night.
* The half-and-half.
* The can opener.

>  I used to be a pizza delivery driver. An asshole stiffed me and was an overall jerk for really no reason. He had a couple pairs of shoes sitting on his porch. After he closed the door on me I took one shoe. Just one.

>  The vegetable peeler. 
When you look for it next time you need it, you’ll convince yourself that you threw it out along with the peelings so you buy another...
And then I steal it again.

>  After having a shitty start to my day these comments brought genuine laughter. I wish we were all friends in the same room. 
I need more of this....

Leave only one egg in each egg carton. The filters in the vacuum cleaner, fridge water dispenser, etc. The sink handles on only the hot water side. One leg from each table and chair. Batteries from TV remotes. All but one coffee filter. The insoles of only the left shoes. The kitty litter container but not the litter. Toilet flush handle. Passifiers. All but the last diaper.  The eject button for the CD/DVD drive. The securing clip to all ethernet plugs. Old man's incontinence supplies. All the vitamin D. Empty out the shampoo bottles. The loofah and scrub brush. Any electric version of things they have a manual version of, like a can opener. The detector material in detectors (causes the alarm to go constantly, americium for smoke detectors).

>  HDMi cables and fridge lights.

>  All the slotted spoons.

>  I'll just turn all the toilet paper rolls in the opposite direction.

>  The cap to their toothpaste

>  I steal their phone charging cables. Sure they're easily replaceable, but then you have go to Walmart or wherever, find the right cable for your phone, decide whether or not you should get a "fancier" one, and how long should the cable be? "How long was my old one? With a longer cable, I can peruse Reddit in bed which I couldn't really do while charging before because the outlet was too far away. Maybe I should just get a cheap one because I want to upgrade my phone soon but then I have to save up $800 for the phone I want and that's going to take awhile so I might as well just buy a better one that's going to last, but then buying a nicer cable would be more expensive and just further postpone buying the new phone and now I have to wait in line..." 



So yeah, mild inconvenience turns into existential crisis.

>  Lead out of all the mechanical pencils, and 98% of the milk.

I'll leave the 2%.

>  Their three sea shells so they have to use toilet paper like some kind of caveman.

>  I would figure out what their most favorite of each weekend clothing item was, like, comfiest bra, saggiest underpants, best socks, etc, and steal those. Then watch them squirming around in the second choice items.

>  Personal hygiene products and support insoles.

>  The fill-valves to all their toilets.

>  Steal their alarm clock, change their alarm to 20 minutes later, give it back.

>  Kettle.
I'm British, so this is more of an inconvenience.
And no, we don't have tea every 5 seconds.
And no again, we don't all speak like the queen.

>  Aglets

>  I would steel animal abusers animals one at a time.

>  A million dollars from Jeff Bezos... he would be more bothered by the idea of his money disappearing than by the impact of not having that money.

>  the cardboard roll inside of the toilet/kitchen roll, the leads from pencils, i would replace all their batteries with ones that are dead, pens replaced with pens with no ink, steel the little usb thing you put in your computer for using wireless keyboards/mouses but leave the actual keyboards/mouses, switch the m & n letter on their keyboards around, mess with their autocorrect, pull the plug slightly out of the socket so much that it doesnt turn on but not so much that its visable, switch certain objects around such as pictures and candles/ ornaments, replace all of their salad stuff with leaves from their garden, move their bookmarks to a differnt page (in actual books), change the links to all of their internet bookmarks, paint the tops of taps/faucets (depending on where you are from) the opposite colours, so the cold tap red and vice versa and for the last thing leave a note on the door saying 'stopped by and you werent in so i left you this note' so they would have no idea who it was and what they wanted and just be really confused for a while asking people he/she knows if it was them.

>  I'd steal a dollar, but I'd also give them back my change so I'm actually just taking 2 cents, give or take.

>  What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier; it's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

>  My brother once came into my home while I was at work and stole literally every battery i had that he could. All double A, triple A, even the ones in the smoke detector cuz he knew I'd just use them for the remote (which I did attempt to do). He then hid then in a box underneath a blanket in my attic.

>  *True Story Alert*

When I was in my freshman year of college, a fraternity I would kick it at threw a party. There was an associate member called Hee-haw Wheesnaw McGraw, or some onomastic partition or aggregation with various rhyming lines.

During the party, we went by his room. Now, Hee-Haw's room was notoriously messy with everything thrown around like those artists who splatter paint around the 3 dimensions of the quadrilatiral room that is their canvas; Wheesnaw's canvas was like that similie but with food and beer cans and blankets and Lord knows what else. So, needless to say we were surprised when entering his room and finding the place not in its normal disarray but in a sort of disarrayed abnormal upturn. 
His room had been entered and slightly trashed. Wheesnaw was steaming mad, talking fastly about the enchaosed chaos that had ended his lathargic ordered room's security, ane thus is before our later discovery. But, that stupor turned to disgusted anger when he discovered a used condum on the floor near his bed; somewhat decided to break into Hee-Haw's room for some dirty pleasure. 
As See-Saw McGraw struggled to keep his composure, we attempted to provide some succor by drawing his attention to theft or burglary.

"Was anything taken?", we asked. "I. I don't know.... Someone fucked in my bed... Where I sleep" came the reply. "Keep it together; was anything stolen? Look around" was our friendly directive. "Uhm. Uhm." He muttered as he shifted his room's contents and took quick stock of whatever sentimental possessions lay scattered, whether by his hand or some horny burglars'. 

All of a sudden, McGraw rushes to his desk. "My computer is still here!" he exclaimed with relief. He picks up his latop with sentiment, and begins turning it over for damage. "Dammit" came the quick reply as he rapdily sets down his laptop and starts searching the desk. "No. No! NO!" he ejaculated. "What?!" was all the rest of us could muster watching this poor, abused guy frantically search under his desk. "They must have taken it" moaned an anguished Whessnaw. "Taken what?", we demanded.

His reply came with a furious scream. "They took my usb plugin for my wireless mouse!" Of course, the realization was only begining to impress itself upon us. "Is it in the mouse?" someone asked. Whessnaw grasped his mouse, flipped it in his left, sweaty and red hand, removing the tiny black trapdoor that conceals such usb adapters. "NO!" He cried aloud. "No. It's gone. They took it! He quickly bellowed in sorrowful recongition of the burglary. 
"Then, why is the mouse here?" Someone else inquired. Well, that question deployed pur mutual recognition of a great burglary beyond any malevolence of Smaug or cunning of Bilbo Baggins. Someone broke into Wheesnaw's room, trashed it and had sex on his bed (although we never did figure the order or simultaneity of the events) and then stole his mouse's usb wireless receiver while leaving the mouse. 

For Wheesnaw, it was like having a bricked phone. During the week when one of the brothers began LAN gaming with other brothers, Wheesnaw became infuriated at his inability to participate not do to ownership of the games, but his purloined usb adapter. That burglar may have taken his most prized possession: the ability to not use his laptop's mousepad like a disoriented seamstress with a high-powered sewing machine. 

You may be wondering how this story ends. Does Wheesnaw catch the burglar(s) and deploy a can of McGraw patented whoop-ass? Perhaps one big misunderstanding is discovered, and his room was just disoriented and he found an old condum? Maybe it was Mr. Plum in the Library with a pipe? 

None of these endings comes to pass. Instead, Wheesnaw turned bright red with tremors of fantastic frenzy and dysphoria; his eyes widening with a vexed girth. He had no choice except accepting his burglary, which was now his bedeviling. Spontaneously, Hee-Haw stormed out out of his room to the bar, snatched someone's fifth of Jagermeister (of course, no other alchohol was in swiping territory) and sucked 6 - 8 shots down. The room rejoiced. Wheesnaw then lit a cigarette, slouched in a chair, and tried tonremain conscious as a silly grin swept over his countenance and replaced his chagrin. 
 
Some houes later, he washed his sheets, cleaned his room for the first and last time ever, and ordered a new adapter, which took days to arrive, causing him to miss out on LAN parties while scouring the house for the old adapter.

She’s anal retentive but never ever asked anyone. Just enough to notice, like someone brushed against it.   For years she went around the house straightening pictures


OR

The toilet paper holder stand. “It LOOKS best closer here”; “But that’s where my knee hits when I sit down” so I’d move it back. We played THAT for 10 years.

>  Their virginity

>  The bolt that connects the shower’s water knob in place.

>  Tea spoons and TV remote

>  Underwear

>  Lightbulbs.
Clothes hangers.
Batteries and charging cables/blocks.
Toilet paper.

And just for fun, I’d take a couple of the good batteries, just so there’s more dead ones than good ones.

>  All the spoons.  Good luck eating your soup with a fork, bitch!

>  The erasers off every pencil and separate ones too

>  All the toilet paper that’s within arm’s reach of the toilet.

>  I heard this from a different thread that had to deal with lawsuit. Since the defendant couldn't pay for things despite being really rich and his house was too much they started taking smaller items that would be super inconvenient like the half-read book on the guys nightstand and the garage door opener.

>  Hmm, stealing the right thing might be difficult. I would say, Remote control to their TV, but those are replaceable.

I'd instead move around their car keys and probably just take that one thing they've been fantasizing about eating in their fridge while they're out.

>  IDE steal utensils, but not obvious ones, ones like a spatula or a can opener.

>  All the remote controls... Actually, that's a big inconvenience. I'll just take out the batteries.

>  Batteries. Empty all remotes, etc. and only leave 2 of each type of battery so they can still use the devices but they must move the batteries from device to device.

>  Sink plug

>  Pizza cutter

>  Replace all batteries with dead ones

>  One glove, right hand, of every pair.  Someone has been doing this to me for years.

>  Only the right feet sock from all the pairs so they will only have socks for left feet

>  10 million dollars from Bill Gates

>  Their grandma

>  Every vowel off of their keyboard.

>  Unplug everything I see plugged in. For good measure, I take the toilet paper out of the holder and put it back the opposite way around. Maybe after that I do what I can to change the temperature of their pillow to be the same as what they're trying to avoid (Turn it warm if this is in the summer, colder if in the winter).

>  I once had someone break into my Nissan that had pay stubs and my girl (at the times) purse. They only took my aux cord. Not only was I pissed but I couldn't listen to music I wanted which pissed me off more for the whole ride home

>  Rather than stealing something I would sneak in, get their IP address, login to their router and change the WiFi password and then change the password to login to the router

>  The base part of every charger

>  Nothing, I’d only switch which way the toilet paper faced

>  All the toilet paper, tissues, napkins, and papertowels the day before christmas.

>  I'd take all the left sides of a family's socks. Then, I’d revisit the place after a while and move on to remove all left-hand gloves, and eventually all left shoes. For added effect, I'd put up "have-you-seen-my-animal" signs in close proximity of the victim's house, featuring a picture of a goat (or something equally weird) sitting on a pile of left shoes. Even better if the photo was taken inside the victim's house - and the "please-call-me" phone# belongs to someone in the family.

>  can openers

>  The caps to all their tubed goods, like toothpaste, neosporin, ect...

Might as well cut their plastic wrap and foil rolls in half too so they have to use up twice as much to do the same job.

>  Coffee filters and door knobs.

>  key rings

>  Socks. But only the left ones

>  All Remote batteries, And replace them with dead ones :b

>  The flapper that keeps the water in the toilet from draining.

>  Every single cord. Charger, power cords, anything I can think of that I use

>  It’s been awhile since I’ve seen a quality askreddit question.

>  Definitely stealing all of their batteries out of TV remotes, game controllers etc. so annoying to sit down before realizing your remote is dead

>  The fire alarm batteries

>  I won’t steal things so much as put them in awfully inconvenient spots.

Like gluing all their socks to the ceiling.

>  Easy one. Their wireless mouse adapters.

>  Garage door openers

>  Deodorant.

>  Their Toaster. I can use myself some toast.

>  Their colander. They decide it’s pasta night, have fun pouring out the water from the pot into the sink!

>  Their lamp shades

>  Their spare car keys

>  Finger nail clippers and tweezers.

>  The last piece of the puzzle

>  My Jeep Wrangler was broken into once. Sliced open my soft top side panel with a blade instead of just unzipping it. What did they steal? My favourite air freshener.   8 years later and I’m still mad AF about it.

>  All emergency provisions. Candles, flashlight, batteries, generator, water, MRE’s.

>  I'm glad nobody here has said "I'd take all their prescription medicine the day after they've refilled it so they have to wait another 30 days "  That would have murderous implications.

>   Bed pillows

>  All the Front door keys so they have to use the back

>  Eat the child and keep the child head there

>  All their cables for everything in the house

>  Toilet paper. They're on the toilet and there's no toilet paper. They sit on the toilet waiting for someone else in the house to get back from the store with some toilet paper. The next time it happens, they're home alone. They grap whatever's closest: a towel. They use it and it gets stained, so they need to throw it out. Gradually over time, they use up all their towels. Once out of towels, they start using tissues and bars of soap. Of course they need to replace these items all the time, and slowly and slowly they start losing money. One day, they go bankrup. The bank takes their house, their car, and all their possessions. They start working second jobs just to have enough money for food. They're living on the streets, sometimes staying over at people's houses. They're so broke they run out of money for blankets, and when winter comes, they start freezing. The wife dies, and now her husband is left alone with nobody. Luckily, his wife had life insurance. He has enough money to rent an appartment. One day he's at the store and he spots the lottery tickets. He decides to buy one, figuring it'll be fun to try. But just his luck, he won. He won a million dollars. He couldn't believe it. He goes to the store and buys all the toilet paper he can get. Little does he know, I'm just around the corner. While he's asleep I raid his stash of toilet paper, and it's all gone by morning. A million dollars worth of toilet paper, gone, just like that. He had nothing again, stuck working two jobs at minimum wage just to pay the bills. He goes and buys a single roll of toilet paper. He puts it in the middle of his living room and goes to sleep. In the middle of the night, he wakes up to the sound of me climbing through his window, and as I'm about to grab the roll, he lunges for it and saves it from my grasp. He gets up and stares me directly in the eyes. This is it. This is the final stand off. With me out of the way, he'll stop losing all of his toilet paper, and he'll finally get his life back in order. He grabs the things closest to him: a bottle. He takes a step towards me. defenceless, I duck as he throws his bottle at my head. It hits the wall and it shatters. He takes another step and I back up. He starts running towards me and tackles me like a bull. He lands a hit right in my nose. I kick him in the leg and push him off me. I run to the other end of the room. My head is pouding, I can feel the blood gushing out of my nose. But the adrenaline is pumping, and I'm ready to win this fight. He gets up slowly, and my right hand feels behing me for something to him him with. I feel a ceramic vase, and my fingers wrap around it and I pull it towards me. He's standing now, staring at me with a look I've never seen before. Once again he runs at me, but this time I'm prepared. Clutching the vase, I lift it in the air and smash it over his head. He falls, only this time he doesn't get up. He's knocked out, so I grab my belt and unwrap it from my waist. I hold up his head and wrap the belt around his neck. I start strangling him, and I don't let go for ten minutes. I feel for a pulse. He doesn't have one. I've won. "All this for a roll of toilet paper?" I think to myself. But I know it was worth it. I grab the roll and leave, looking for another victime to slea from.

>  Phone chargers, hdmi cables, batteries to smoke alarms. Let’s do this.

>  The *backs* of their earings

>  the handle that flushes the toilet

>  #W I N D E X


Edit: I have a better one. Get a pair of scissors and cut the aglets off of ALL of their laces. Pants, shoes, hoodies, anything. Aglets are the little thing on the end that makes it not fray in every direction.

Edit 2: all of their pillowcases.

>  Tupperware lids

His good ties

One shoe lace

Spare keys

Minutes hands from all analog clocks.

>  Their child

>  Doorknobs

>  All the spoons

>  Coffee cups, remote controls, all the matched socks.

>  Haven't seen anyone stealing the backs to battery operated electronics. Like...the back of the remote for instance.

>  I'll take their can opener because it's something that isn't really noticed until it's needed. So when they need to open a can, they wont be able to find one and they'll have to open the can like the savages they are

>  All the reader glasses in the house.

>  10mm socket

>  The rotating glass disk in a microwave

>  Every 10mm socket and wrench.

>  Instead of stealing their car, I would just take the steering wheel.

>  The 30 second button on the microwave

>  TV remotes and left shoes

>  The ring that your keys are on

>  I would cut all of the electrical wiring from the outside, fuses, flash lights, and light bulbs.

>  A dollar from everyone in the house.

>  All the fucking double A batteries

>  All charging cords in the house

>  All their outlets.

>  All their light bulbs.

>  Every single roll of toilet paper

>  Some of the knobs off cabinets so you have to fumble around trying to open them with your fingers on the edge.

>  Buttons.
Buttons on pants, shirts, the buttons on the key fob, the buttons in the remote control, the tv. 
Every single button

>  The cords to all of their electronics

>   Batteries from every remote in the house

>  The button in the middle of each button up shirt

>  Cheese grater, good luck making nachos fuckwad

>  The dildo

>  All their hair ties.

>  A 10mm socket

>  One battery out of everything, or just the plug off all the things plugged into the wall.

>  Every year or so I get angry enough about the lid situation to go through the entire container cupboard and match them all and throw away the ones that don't go to anything.

2 weeks later I'm swearing at the damn containers again. It's ridiculous. I think someone is sneaking in and stealing lids.

>  The chain that connects the flusher to the flipper inside the toilet.

No flush for you bitch.

>  I take all of the charger cables for their phones/computers/etc, but leave the blocks.

>  Springs of mechanical pencils and pens.

>  The glass tray from the microwave and the racks from the oven.

>  I go to the fridge and steal one thing every day. This will cause the family to get mad at each other because of who stole their pudding. I will continue to do this until the family is broken up.

>  Their virginity

>  All of their powerstrips

>  The printer ink... That shit would drive me insane

>  One contact lens

>  All knobs to the stove. Sure it still works...but isnt that just so ugly? That or all the pot holders

>  1: take the toilet paper, make it wet. Just every roll in the house. Leave them whole so that the person then will go to get paper, it falls appart. Go for a spare roll? Too bad. Crab walk for the multipack you got 2 days back on sale? Whoops!

2: hairties. Make sure they dont have any on them, then just take them all assuming they have long hair. Long hair is annoying. 

3: remove toothpaste from tubes, refill with anything else. 

4: take all bin liners and bags. They will see the bin is overflowing, go to remove it and get a bag, and have none. Now they have to go buy more. 

5: bend the cutlery. 

6: take half the screws out of hinges. Also if you can make them squeak. 

7: take any opaque bottles, empty them, fill with water or the wrong products. Body wash is now conditioner, shampoo is in the conditioner bottle and the shampoo bottle is water. 

8: dull any knives in the house. 

9: water down the soap a lot. 

10: change the settings on their heating if you can. Make it that bit too hot/cold.

>  Dog/cat/animal food/water bowls; cut toothbrushes in half (like, length wise) and take the other half; remove handles from all cabinets and drawers, maybe even the fridge; cut the power cord for the dryer, so that way they end up using the washer and can't use the dryer; dig holes into the yard so they fall into them randomly, and eventually having to take random paths in the yard, to avoid the holes, only to find more; put a lock on everything possible; the cold handle for the sink(s); 3 tiles from the shower walls, in no pattern; and lastly I'd replace their tires with slightly smaller tires and pop one of the new ones so they have to go get a replacement and when they return with it they'll fix the flat just to find their vehicle sitting lopsided, since the new tire they just bought, will be larger than the other three. Thank you 💕

>  What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany’s at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It’s priceless. As I’m taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It’s her father’s business. She’s Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don’t trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he’s the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She’s been waiting for me all these years. She’s never taken another lover. I don’t care. I don’t show up. I go to Berlin. That’s where I stashed the chandelier.

>  Not steal but just take the SD/microSD cards out of everything and hide them around the house. Just spent multiple months looking for a microSD I lost and it was under my bed. tore apart my entire room for it too.

>  On a serious note, this is what the Stasi did to dissidents and political rights activists (I am sure other Communist countries did similar things). 

They would enter someone's home, and then slightly rearrange stuff in the kitchen, or steal the coffee filters, etc. It was a routine element of a number of measures to mentally stabilise these dissidents. Either they were believing they were slowly going mad, because they mislaid all those things. Or they would somehow suspect that someone was in their house, but would not know when, or who, or what else they did while they were there.

It's basically a form of psychological torture.

Inevitably they'll forget at some point and have to unplug their charger from the outlet just out of reach behind the couch and plug it in an outlet in the bedroom.   Now the one by the nightstand again is out of reach because the top outlet already has the electronic tooth brush plugged in so they can't see the bottom outlet.   On the other hand they can use the outlet across the room but now they have to get out of bed to hit the snooze button so they might as well just wake up.

What I thought was funny about moving the decorations was imagining the owner coming out and noticing all their stuff was in the neighbors yard all set up and bring like WHAT THE FUCK. If I came out to my stuff was moved next door I would probably start cry laughing because I would have learned just how annoying that would be. So the only I stole was time and patience mainly.

My highschool girlfriend and I traveled from Richmond to Charlotte to see visit her brother and went to a house party.

We thought it would be funny to steal one of the peas out of the pod.

That missing pea got him busted for throwing the party.

Fast forward about a year. Same scenario. Same kid in the same house. We knew about the party beforehand so... we brought the pea and put it back without telling him.

That returned pea got him busted for throwing the party.

The police showed up at some point and everyone started chanting "fuck the police" and then someone shouted "SCATTER." A few years later the comedian was over at his mates house and his mate brought him into a secret room at the back of his bedroom. Inside the walls were completely covered with photographs that the friend had stolen from random parties he's gone too. The comedian just said "why?" And the friend replied "because photographs are the one thing, families can't replace"

What I'd do is move things all over the place. Remote left on the table? Now it's on the top shelf of that cupboard you never open, and the batteries are between the cushions. Phone? it's now off and in the vegetable crisper. Keys? Have you checked inside your shoes?

Someone stole mine from my apartment at a party and I tore the entire place apart for weeks with my roommate. We obviously resorted to blaming each other and searching each other’s rooms thoroughly assuming the other brought it in there by accident. We accused other friends who had been at the party, you know just a casual modern day witch hunt. 

The guy returned it a month later.

>  All their silverware, every single one

>  I'd take one battery out of every electronic just to extremely annoy them.

>  I have been doing this for the past 3 years. A couple of friends and I started an underground thing senior year of high school called the "Petty Theft Club." And it's exactly that, we steal things that would minorly inconvenience someone. 

We started with a movie poster that was in a storage room in our high school. Then it went to taking one pencil at a time from our least favorite teacher's desk. We stole a couple of match box cars from our physics classroom. A box of razor blades from the biology lab room. We took the spare key to one of the empty cabinets in the chemistry classroom. 

Freshman year of college, over the course of the entire school year, I took 17 bricks out of the middle of the most popular walking path on my campus. I would unscrew lightbulb covers and take only the cover, leaving exposed lightbulbs. At least 2 wet floor signs After the floor was dried up of course, because I don't want anyone to slip.

Now it's my sophomore year in college.  First I took a half-empty container of Tide pods is now mine.  Then I took a San Diego Toreros football when they came to my university to play our football team. I have managed to get plenty of t-shirts from givaways where I should not have gotten a t-shirt. And perhaps my favorite one yet, I stole one of the volleyball team's nicest warmup volleyballs. 

Cheers to many years to come!

>  That's  a good one Here's  my list:
•Piercings and earrings  etc. That irritates  a lot of people also they gonna spent a lot of time searching  on the ground or remembering  the las time they used them.
•Salt. If you cook you're  gonna miss that white thing 3 times a day. Most  of the food taste like sh*t without  salt.

It looks like they are just  dumb stuff  but this  things would make a sh*tty way to start a day. Sorry for the bad English.

When they want to relax in front of the TV, they don't see it coming.
Then! They try it, it doesn't work, then they have to stand up and search for the extra ones.

But hey, I stole them as well.

So in the best (worst for them) case, they have to go shopping instead of chilling on the couch.

For example can't find your keys?  There always on the coffee table cuz that's where you toss em when coming in from work right?  Where did you put em? Did they fall and are under the table? No. 

Check the key rack. 

What about your wallet? Eh you just leave it in your pants from the day before or toss it by you bed when you change. Crap... where did you put it now.... did you leave it at work?  Or worse the bar from last night?  You call the bar if its still open....nope no wallet got turned in..... ughhh now your gonna have to cancel your cards and apply for new ones.... you'll do that later on your lunch break. 

Wait did I really leave it in the catch all tray my significant other bought for the house that I said I wouldn't use because thats "unnecessary"?

When my sister and I were 12 & 13 our family lived in a home owned by our aunt. (Mother's Sister) Aunt one day decides she wants to move back into the house, & with very little notice tells our family of 5 to find another home. My sister and I are just old enough to know we are mad on behalf of the family and we are going to payback Mean Auntie! So our last day there, we removed every single light bulb in her house and smash them on the side of her garage! We were so proud of ourselves for it! We knew she would be coming back from an international trip late and wouldn't be able to see! Huzzah! 20+ years later same Auntie and Sister and I are talking about what we did. We feel silly and Mean Auntie said, "I knew you guys did it. I thought it was very cute of you. Fighting for your family." And we all laughed.

Vehicles normally wait for them across the valleys. The first thing they grab is electronics, after that everything else is pretty much the icing. Electronics and tools are sold, and everything else is distributed amongst family members. Nothing is sacred!

So the guy who's telling the story went on to talk about how he went over to one of his friends' houses a few years later, and that friend showed him a secret room filled with stolen family photos.

So I'd steal the fuse out of the plug for some sort of appliance which is used _fairly_ regularly but not every day. Maybe the vacuum cleaner?

How long do you think it would take someone to work that one out when it doesn't turn on? Then, if they took the appliance somewhere to try and have it repaired, imagine the "you fucking idiot" look the person in the shop would give them when they found the problem.

Pickles, maraschino cherries, preserves from grandma, etc. Late night snacking would probably decrease though, so maybe it would be a good weight loss strategy. Dammit the inconvience burglar has accidentally helped people be healthier.

>  I would either steal an amount of their cutlery but not make it the same amount.
So for example there are 2 knives and 2 forks left, but there are 3 spoons

Squeeze out all the shampoo in all your bottles, leave the shampoo in the shower and just steal the bottle

The flush handle on your toilet

Only the glass part of the lightbulb in your bathroom not the inner parts

A few feet of baseboard 

All your pet food if you have a pet (but leave enough for the pet until you can buy more)

Same thing as the shampoo bottle(s) but with laundry detergent

The esc key on your keyboard

The clip that holds your bread in the package

>  I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

The only item we'll look for over a period of days; before ever admitting the TV box can be operated without it. 

Definitely a remote.

Of course there are rules to hiding it.

If they're not a peanut butter person, whatever they use in place of peanut butter.  For some people, this might mean taking something completely different, like mayonnaise.   The ingredient I'd be looking for is whatever is an essential component in *their* sandwiches.

>  In college, my roommate Kelly and I would do laundry at our friend Steve's house down the street. He had given us a key so we could go when he was at work (big mistake). Over the course of about a month, we would steal little things every few days...a framed photo, a lamp, etc. Stuff he wouldn't really notice IMMEDIATELY, but something would just seem...off. But we would then put the stolen item in OUR house (and he was at our house almost every night), somewhere visible, but not super obvious. We started with small items but eventually started taking things that would be more noticeable. He would come over, and we'd see him looking around, a little confused, but still not getting it. It wasn't until we took a 3 x 3' painting that had been hanging in his living room and put it over our fireplace that he finally figured it out. And he said that the sad part was that he really didn't notice that when he was home, but once he saw it in our living room, the pieces all started fitting together. He hadn't noticed the framed photo of his family sitting on our mantle, or his favorite coffee mug next to the coffee pot (which he used often). He said that he had thought he was starting to go crazy, but couldn't figure out what it was. He thought it was funny, at least, but got his revenge when he took our clothes out of the washing machine and replaced them with an entire load of his socks and underwear. But playing the long game is a great way to inconvenience someone, and possibly make them go a little insane.

G: "M...M! You know those little hammer things that judges have?"
M: "Yeah, it's called a gavel, why?" 
G: "Come here!" 

Sure enough, there was a commemorative gavel which celebrated this judge for having served with integrity and so forth. So we took that. I don't know what happened to it, but surely the statute of limitations has passed by now. 

We ended up being busted a month later for another stupid crime. 14 year old me was an idiot.

>  MOST of the forks in their silverware drawer. 

Not all of them, because they would immediately notice they have no forks and go and buy some cutlery.

Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

Company hires a new land lady (LL from now on). Landlords always get an apartment with the office attached. They have to follow the same housing rules as everyone else plus keep regular business hours, whatever those were. No more than 3 adults per unit & 2 per bedroom (so 1 beds could have 2 adults, 2 beds could have 3 adults, but not 4), all must be related by blood or marriage, no felons, no sex offenders, must pass credit check. They also have to respond to maintenance complaints and provide 24 hour notice before entering an apartment (except emergency). Pretty standard. 

"Break" in 1: found a used condom on my bedroom floor. Was too big to fit my partner at the time. "Okay, maybe it expanded some how and we didn't clean it up." Ignored it 

Robbery 1: stole a Gatorade from my fridge and left a half drank one on my window sill. "Maybe I drank more than I realized" Ignored it 

Robbery 2: another Gatorade. Some food. "Weird, but who would do that?" Called partner who lived 2 hours away. He hadn't been over for a few weeks. Ignored it.

Break in 2: Stuff was moved but again, no money, no electronics were taken. Ignored it. 

Break in 3: A keepsake I had in a special box in my living room was on my bedroom windowsill. NEVER would I have placed it there. 

So I go banging on the office door, about 8 pm. Demanding to know if they (LL, LL's wife or maintenance) had been in my apartment. I already had documented issue with them coming in with no notice while I was at work. Asperger's moment but it was "to fix the dishwasher" or other excuses. I needed it fixed so I was like okay, but you have to tell me. They said they hadn't today so I called the cops and told them. (Cop lost it when I told him about the condom being too big. He tried so hard to keep it professional lol) 

Eventually chocked it up to the previous tenant was trying to find something left behind. Made sense. They had to evict the guy for sanitation reasons. Took 6 truck bed loads of garbage to clean the place. Issues continued to the point I was blocking the door and leaving through a window unless they started to use that entrance too. I felt there was nothing I could do. 

Long story short - Maintenance was LL's felon, registered sex offender ex-husband. He was living in the office apartment with LL and her new wife. He was using the maintenance keys to enter people's apartments when they were gone. This is why they refused my repeated requests to change my locks, then said they would if I paid a 50$ installation fee. Original land lady said that wasn't a real fee Company charges. So they would have just pocketed it and kept entering whenever they wanted. 

How did I get it to stop? A realtor for Company came in to the Subway where I worked at the time and I thought he was a big wig with the apartments so I just let lose all of above, how they had refused to fix my mailbox door (which was leading to mail theft), how they completely removed the door after repeated requests (which meant the post office refused to deliver my mail), things being stolen off my doorstep, the creepy old guy who walked around in his underwear and leered at me (young and alone then), I could never get a receipt for my rent (original land lady's assistant has pocketed a month's rent which I had to replace and 100$ in late fees), the office was never open, maintenance was living with LL and wife, and other problems I was having. 

I unloaded months of frustration and fear to this poor man on his lunch break. He was just kind of frazzled and explained he worked in real estate sales but took my information to pass to the leasing team. They were moving out by the time I got off shift that day.

Then I set all the digital clocks forward by 7 minutes. They will still all read the same time but they will be off just enough to be noticeable. So I’ve either stolen the moments it takes them to readjust them or I take all the moments where the person has to do math in their head to remember the real time is 5:46 and not 4:53. Furthermore when they leave in the morning they will be 7 minutes early for their bus. Not late so they miss the bus. They will be early so they have to stand in the cold waiting.

You see, when I was a kid in the early 80’s, someone broke into our house, stole a bunch of things (including my mom’s wedding ring) and...
...The remote control to our new TV.  

(yes, they did leave the TV).
The only reasoning we could think of was that TV remote controls were still kind of new at this point (this one wasn’t even infrared, it emitted sound you couldn’t hear) and the thief probably thought it was a calculator or something.

Up until not long ago, my family had a broken drawer for months, which we used everyday.  It took like five minutes to get it out, and like five minutes to get it back into a good enough position.

I even had to come up with a thing to trap the shower head between two of the shower screens so I don't actually die of hypothermia while trying to wash my hair. A couple of times my life hack fell off and I made a mess in the bathroom but I'm willing to risk it.

Indignant that someone had abandoned their candy post, we stepped into the foyer to get grab our own handful from the bowl provided. Then we proceeded to grab the TV remote sitting on the table next to the candy and quickly slip out. Those poor bastards probably lost their minds looking for that remote. I still feel a mix of guilt and shame with a dash of amusement.

>  Their toothbrush, and their backup toothbrushes.

>  I'll mix their silverware drawer

>  Lids

>  The doorknobs to all of the doors in the house, or garage door chains

>  their toilet paper and leave the cardboard in the middle

>  Tupperware lids

>  All of their spoons except for like one or 2. It's annoying having to re wash the same exact soon every time you need one. I say this cause we have suspicions that someone has done that to us or we have a spoon stealing ghost.

>  Sharp knives so they have to cut steak with a butterknife.

>  A little thing here and there, like a 2 forks, a knife, 2 spoons, a pencil, a pen, a book etc. Just stuff you don't notice at once but start to wonder where they are after a while.

>  Those things that hold toilet paper rolls

>  All of the toilet paper.  Ok that would be funny.  And maybe their skincare products.  I know how freaked I can get when I run out of my moisturizer.

>  Car keys

>  Their tv remote. Drive by their house once in a while and change the channel while they're watching tv.

>  My friend told me that one of her friends got her car broken into... and they only stole the iPhone charging cable. 

So probably that.

>  The chains from all the toilets so they can't be flushed.

>  You have to play it smart - things that no one will immediately notice but will inconvenience them the moment they need it.

A battery out of a wireless mouse or remote, the dust pans, the cords for kitchen appliances, one wheel off a chair, toilet paper, empty the soap bottles and put the bottles back, any trash bags, some forks and spoons so they only have a full set of knives from their kitchen sets, the Ethernet cords but only some so a few devices still work fine,if they have a book of computer passwords grab that, if you know a holiday like Christmas is coming take half of the canned cranberry sauce, put the other half back in the cupboard behind everything, just so you can take their hopes as well.

Do it over time, slowly, they'll go nuts.

The key is to do it slowly and keep the tags the same so they question their whole reality by the end when their shoes don't fit anymore and they have to bundle up to go outside, only to find belly-shirts and a child's coat.

>  Random pieces of clothing they laid out for the next day, maybe not completely stealing some. Just like, moving it somewhere else in their home. Rinse and repeat and I become the clothes napping ghost that they tell their kids about. Till the same happens to their kids, and they panic. They call a close family friend to come to keep watch, The close friend can’t come so they send their older kid. I’m the older kid, they don’t know it, now I know exactly what they’ve done to adapt. Instead of laying their clothes out they put them more organized in their drawers. Perfect, with inside access say I left something in there room. I switch all their outfits while they go out to dinner. I call the neighbor and they switch places with me while I tell their kids that he did it. They come home to the neighbor and find out their clothes are scrambled, the neighbor says it was me but their kids say otherwise. The neighbor gets charged and I get to see them everyday in wacky misplaced outfits on rush days. Eventually I tell them it was me but they ignore me, the news comes on and an accident at a nearby college comes up and they learn the news. They frantically try to lay out their clothes in hopes they will be misplaced. But alas, nothing ever comes up. Their kids much older now made a memorial, for me, the clothes napping ghost, who actually became a ghost.

The light blinks on it, which is annoying, so they have to change their change  batteries. Then when they do. The remote doesn't work for that TV and they either have to reprogram it, which most people don't have the remote directions to reprogram it, now they have to call Customer Service for a fucking cable company, no matter what company they're always a fucking pain. 
Most remotes you have to hold the setup button to program it with a code for your tv. Which i also would have scraped the brand off of it and changed the input to an output they don't use.

If I really wanna screw with em I’ll switch where they store their cups and mugs with where they keep their plates and bowls.

However, in place of the remote control I leave a much more expensive item. For instance, I steal a remote but leave them a 70" flat screen tv, which I then steal the remote from. It's so diabolical because then they have to drive and spend time to get a remote so they can use their tv. That's at least 20 maybe 30 minutes out of their life. It'll ruin them.

Story behind this: we had to get out of our rental but technically didnt have the A-okay to move into our house my parents were building. We stayed in a hotel for 2 weeks while they were finishing up but we put all of our stuff in the new house garage. For some reason my parents put all the remotes together.

When I lived in Rwanda someone broken into our house. I woke up when they tripped on a box. I chased them out of the house (he dove through a window, and o was nude so didn't follow. 

We turned all the lights on and checked out what they stole:

- all my shoes.
- all our milk
- our yogurt
- a bottle of white wine. 

That's all.

After that it would be small, petty shit. Stuff like door stops, ceiling fan rope switches. 

One of the most inconvenient things in my house is the fact that the builder put the light switch on the wrong side of my door. So every day I have to swing the door open, enter in the dark, shut the door and then turn the light on.

It seems small at first but it becomes very annoying. But that's not stealing and would take some work.

My friends and I came up with this elaborate plan while we were in the navy just trying to pass time and we've tried it on each other many times. Whoever we did it too was severely frustrated and angry but it was well worth all the formal grievances and headaches because we never snitched on each other and they never got their stuff back.

A zipper from each jacket or pair of pants or one obvious button from each shirt.  One lens from each pair of glasses.

I hope nobody is planning to use these ideas to drive people nuts.  :-)

>  Steal someone's outfit. I would find a victim who just got a new outfit. Then I would hire a group of people to wear the same outfit, bonus points if they are beautiful. Then find where the person is going and have a person be planted in that location and wearing the same outfit. Even better if another actor is there and gives the planted outfit stealer compliments on their outfit. Then the actor sees the victim and says something like 'oh, I see you're taking fashion advice from this person here. Haha' then when the person goes to another store or something have another person in the same outfit. Everyone will be wearing hidden cameras and wired with bluetooth headsets as well. The more unique and hard to find the outfit, the better.

They used the bathroom, got something to drink, and took nothing. They left a stale cigarette smell in the bathroom, and anytime I get a whiff of it when I’m out and about, it brings back the same unsettled feeling.

I took the report and told then if anything else they discovered missing needed to be added to the property section. A week later I got a call saying the film camera they reported missing had been discovered under the bed. Another week after that, I got a frantic call from them. I went to their house and they developed the film.. regular photos until about half. Way through, and then a photo of a big black ass that had the bristle ends of toothbrushes inserted. It was the couples' tooth brushes. That they had been using since they returned. I guess they would rather have had their toothbrushes stolen.

It got so bad that we began locking our soap in our mini-safe. 

We never did find that thief either...

>  I would steal someone's videogame password, then play it just a bit. I would wait til they were near a level up, then I would level them up. When it's time to distribute points, I will mess up their character build just a tiny bit. Not enough for them to notice right away. I would also make their character just slightly uglier every time I did this. Not enough to notice right away. I would also steal pens. Just one at a time. I would also use their pencils. NOT steal the pencils tho, just use them a bit. Enough for them to have a general feeling that someone used their pencil a bit. I will use the pencil on my crazy thief person's notebook to document when I stole which pen, how I did it, and when the next pen victim will be. I will also keep and use the pens in front of the victim, and when they insist that I stole their pen I will make an elaborate story of how I bought it and when. The days I 'buy' these pens will directly correllate with the date that the pen went missing. I will also in my crazy person notebook document how much that pen is actually worth on that specific date and where it can be bought (it will be written with said pen, of course) You know. So I have an alibi. Once the pen has done it's job through the ritual, I will 'accidenally' leave it in a public place that the person convenients a lot. Like a gas station, bank, etc. That way I will slowly induct others into my secret pen stealing cult. I gotta go, my next victim awaits.

I would take their phone chargers, wifi passwords, tupperware lids.

I would take all their doors, so everyone could see what I did.

Every placemat, their slippers, and every dryer sheet.

I would browse their DVR, on every show I would hit delete.

I would take their plunger, their washcloths, and all their bars of soap.

But that's all I would take, at least that's what they would hope.

Chairs untucked, a couch slightly askew, the position of their beds would be changed.

You can be sure all their furniture would have been ever so slightly rearranged!

I wouldn't dare touch their computer though, in fact I wouldn't even log them out of reddit.

I would even leave them one gilded post, from their name of course so they could reap the karma credit.

I'd have stolen their internet identity, since they'd have to delete their account with dismay.

Because there on the front page, their salacious browser history would be completely on display.

>  It would be very difficult to only slightly inconvenience people if you burgle their homes. If you secretly steal stuff that they will notice missing then you might have them questing their memory of it, and you'd essentially be gaslighting them.

If you make it obvious that you've stolen it then you'd hugely upset people by violating their home.

You'd have to steal things that people find useful but don't know for sure that they own until they want to use it.

Or steal from workplaces with lots of people rather than homes.
