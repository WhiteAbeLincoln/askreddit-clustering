>  I go nowhere because Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, whether they're right or not, or even have sources for whatever they're editing. The entirety of wikipedia could be inaccurate for all I know, or maybe not everything, but a good chunk of it is likely inaccurate, and I don't know which bits are accurate and which aren't, so I don't trust any of it fully.

Edit: Spelling

This helps you out because present problems could have been fixed and new methods of things we do already will have been made.

Start out with the ultimate encyclopaedia, not a poser one

>  Does my internet access only allow Wikipedia ?

>  ...and Wikipedia?

I can’t take the Encyclopedia Britannica or a special edition of Wikipedia that’s been cleansed of inaccurate facts, spam, and trolling so that I don’t get myself into further trouble?

Does this cloaking device work on me or the ship? I’m Black; I can’t be visiting much of the past willy-Billy without literal cover.

>  Back to before Wikipedia was created and create wikipedia.

>  August 4th, 1914:

The Social Democratic Party of Germany votes to allow the War Bonds for the first world war. It began the shism between the labour movement.

I would show them the Wikipedia page of Rosa Luxemburg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg?wprov=sfla1

And of course the pages on world war 1, world war 2 and the Holocaust.

>  Well, I first get rid of Wikipedia because it's biased and useless and then I instantly travel to Ancient Mesopotamia. That period sounds really interesting.

>  Is Wikipedia for reference or so that you can update all the incorrect history on there?

>  Is this assuming an accurate wikipedia? Or one with a page on the existence of tree octopi?

In my favor of course. Think I'd give a damn a lot more than whoever's running the show now.

>  I’d go back to all the great empires and pretend to be an immortal wizard that only appears when he’s needed and advise rulers toward a better future for humanity

>  I would go to the 4th of September 2006 and save Steve irwin, he was my hero :)

>  Outland by Dennis E. Taylor has it right. You go back in time and use your historical knowledge of gold deposits and you make bank.

>  Go back to the early humans and teach them how to do some stuff. Then go back to present day and see the difference... which will have probably pushed every event many years forward so when I go back the world will probably not exist anymore

>  Id probably go back and re-find something extremely valuable, hide the money, do it a couple more times and hide money elsewhere, then maybe build my house and just buy it back now, so I have an older style home. Maybe get some fancy muscle cars new and park them somewhere so I could go get them now untouched. I don't need to change everything about the world, but live through some fun times I wasn't born to see

>  Okay. So, first I would go to December 25th, 1776. I would arrive in my cloaked ship and land it. I'd help George Washington get across the Delaware River by fucking flying him over it, as he would have no idea. George Washington would then believe, of course, god was on his side. After dropped him off, I'd put on some badass Cloak-And-Dagger type costume, and walk out. There would be paintings of me, the man of god. Oh, but no, I'm not done yet. I'd go to the times of Ancient Egypt, and literally create the fucking pyramids with the Matter Replicator. Do the same cloak and dagger stuff, and warp back. Easily gives me some cool Egyptian carvings. Got two more in me. I'd go visit Cavemen, and show them how to create fire. Some hieroglyphics of me. Finally, April 30th, 1945. The day that Hitler killed himself. I'd shoot him instead, of course taking the credit of killing him, having his guards in as Hitler panicked in his bunker. Boom. I'd become a fucking *time legend.*  


TL;DR: Become a badass throughout time by taking credit for major events in history.

>  I go back to my bedroom in May of 2013, the year I was raped, and beat the shit out the person who violated me.Then I would tell the younger me that everything would be okay and that I had a beautiful future.

>  Back in time to when my stepdad got first sick and spend more time with him before he passed away.

>  I would not change or alter anything at first. First thing I do is go back to when Jesus was on earth and invisibly observe what he was like. Then I would go back further to the point of early humans and see what they were like. I would basically get an idea of early humanity before doing anything else.

>  I would go to the patent office, that kind of technology is years ahead of the planet.

>  Go back and stop the dick head that stole my snacks

>  I would go to sometime before my grandpa dies. I would really like to tell him about my current life, how I found an amazing girl, and mostly I'd just like to talk with him and hear his stories and jokes again.

>  I’d go back to 1960 to when I was 6 and before my Dad died.

>  I would go back to the week before my grandmother passed away, and that night she called wanting me to take her to the store, and not only what I take her to the store but I would buy her the best meal that I possibly could. I would also by her dogs whatever they wanted, and just sit there and spend time with her no matter what she wanted to do or what I wanted to do.

>  Ok so technically speaking I could do something then go back and it would have never happened right. So do some crime for fun then go back and reverse it. Or gather some friends and go on a time travel adventure. Maybe even get a hot tub.

>  First, I would go to see my Norse ancestors. See the first king of Denmark: Gorm the Old and his son Harald Bluetooth. 

Then back in time to see Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

>  Hey /u/_21928274999 does it function as a teleport as well or do you just go back to the same place

>  I'd go back and meet my great great great grandparents and see how they lived and what type of people they were.

>  I'd go back in time and make sure Tesla got the credit he deserved. What a legend. Fuck Edison.

>  Go back and save my sister from drowning

>  I would go back to the time of the Salem witch trials, with all that I would either save hundreds of lives. As they would stop hunting all those people and chase me. Or I would be declared their king and use my knowledge to advance things for humanity even further.

>  I would go to when I was one year old and stay in that time so I could keep a watch over myself, and save myself from some terrible things. 

I would work at my old daycare and become a mentor-type person to my younger self, mentally prepare myself for what's to come and just be there for me.

>  "Hey Columbus, this isn't India."

"It isn't? Oh well, let's go back crew."

>  I would go kill my grandfather and create a loop.

>  I would go back to before the library of Alexandria burned down replicate the whole thing and put it somewhere. Then when it burns down I wait a week and put the replicated one in its place. People would go insane that it just reapears.

>  I would go to the 70’s. Maybe to nyc or la and just walk down the street observing. Then after that I’d go to tons of concerts in different decades. Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix. I’d want to go to my parent’s childhood towns and maybe see them there.

>  I would go back 74 years and give Donald Trump's father a condom.

>  Back to bed.  If I miss anything I'll just double back and catch up.

>  Go back three months ago to tell my friend to not get in the car that night, maybe then he’d still be with us

>  It depends. If it keeps oxygen levels the same then I would go back in time to the dinosaurs and take some gnarly pictures/souvenirs (only if it has avengers endgame time travel rules). If oxygen levels change in the time machine, id instead go back to the time when the tazmanian tiger existed and take a bunch of them with me back to now so they can repopulate tazmania

>  I'd want to go back to when Indonesia was fighting for its independence and see what grandparents did during that time. I know my grandmother lost a brother who was accused of being a resistance fighter, I know one grandfather was in intelligence and the other was an army doctor. Other than that it's just bits and pieces of information. They've all since passed so I'd like to learn more about them this way.

>  I would got far back enough to see how it all started.

>  Go back in time to major events and find out none of them happened so I have to step in and make them happen.

Sorry Lincoln.

>  I’d go back nearly a year ago right before my dad passed away on Tuesday December 18th 2018 at 7PM. But I’d go before then, on the Sunday probably. I’d go hang out with him and talk about sports and talk about how much I appreciate him and love him. My deepest regret is that I was so busy with my own life I didn’t bother to think about his because when he passed we hadn’t talked in weeks.

>  I would go to 1943 so I cou- oh wait never mind. I’m black.

>  I would go to WW1 cloaked as a hot milf and give Hitler the love he deserves

>  I'd go back to end of last year and see my nana.

>  I'd go back to the day before my best friend died in a car accident and hug him.

>  I’d go back to start recovering lost knowledge from the 45k years of human history before the invention of writing. See out the most learned, knowledgeable folks from that span. Lots of legwork required first; finding out who/where/when they are. But the returns would be incredible.

>  First of I would create a time undo button to reverse any possible problematic action I created by interfering. 

Then go back in time to the point before Hitler was received. Would stop that. Go back to my time to see the result. Hopefully I would be able to meet my grandfather. 

Also I would use it to sleep.

>  Back to the 1st grade so I could sneak up and pour a bunch of fiberglass insulation shavings down the back of Joel’s shirt so he’s itchy all damn day. F U Joel

>  This will sound weird, but I would go back in time.

First to visit, King Henry VIII.

Then Queen Victoria

Third, I would go to 1935 and protect some jews, (being invisible)

Fourth I would go into the future, to 2040, to see myself AND MAKE SURE I AM **STILL** NOT SINGLE. Though i probably still will be :'p

>  I would go back about 3 years ago to make my grandma go to the hospital so that they could find her cancer faster than they did, so that maybe she would still be alive today. I really miss her, and I wish I could see her again.

>  Go back to before the discovery of the Americas and go meet Chistopher Columbus to threaten him that if he kills any Native Americans, he and his crewship will be cursed. He'll be forced to believe me considering how dumb people were at that time and with our technology he won't understand

>  go back in time and kill all religious "messiahs". And no i don't have any hate for your beliefs, they're just bs

>  Go back 5 years ago to help them find my grandma's Cancer early, and to kiss a girl that's it

>  Back 5 years and say to past me to buy Bitcoin

>  Go back to prevent that moment when I was at the cinema with my crush and when the snacks-guy asked me if I wanted Cheese, Salsa or Sour Cream for my nachos, and my reply was "yes".

>  I would go back to when my dad was in high school and see if he really had to climb 7 mountains, cross two seas, and slog through the Sahara to reach school

>  Go back and rickroll fools from like 20 years ago

>  I would memorise two solar eclipses (using Wikipedia) from medival times and go back in time to the day before the first one then tell everyone it is going to happen and then when it does happen immediately tell them when the next one is going to happen. They would probably think I was some kind of God and thus I would be treated amazingly well possibly become the ruler. Then I could bring future technology to this city and make immensely technologically advanced for its time and conquer the world

>  I'd probably go back in time to Aztec times then I'd steal a bunch of stuff using a Lazer gun I just created then burry it were only I'd know then go to the future and unburry it and make profit then use that profit to buy Netflix and get rid off all their original series' 
and adaptations (yes stranger things will get removed come at me) I'll make sure when the joker is available it gets on netflix. then useit to give my free accounts then just make profit because I'm not wasting money on that Netflix original crap

TL;DR: I'd buy Netflix get rid off all the junk then buy the rights to put the joker movie on it

>  I would go back 2 years from now, kidnap myself, take his place and talk to my crush myself to prove im not actually a retard

>  Go back in time and tell myself exams questions😆

>  I would go back to 2015 to see my three first pet bunnies, Veera, Liisa and Eetu (former Elina, but we soon found out that Eetu wasn't a she). I would hug and hold them and give them kisses and tell them how much I missed them. And then my dad would probably show up asking who tf I was and I would probably try to prove myself before getting the fuck out of there and telling him "See ya in 2019!" No one will believe him and he'll have deja vu when he sees me after my trip into 2015 lmao.

>  I would go back in time and stop reddit from happening. ;)

>  I would first travel forward in time researching more as I went and adding to my already vast knowledge and “library” of information, finding cures to diseases ways to live longer and technologies that even amazed me. I would then go back to the present for a couple years each time going back to the same time and learning another ancient and almost forgotten language, then once I’m fluent in most of the ancient languages (all them that can still be taught) I would have relived the same years many times but each time just learning one more language. I would then travel to Ancient Rome or Greece and stand before them as a god, I would teach them many things from their future and progress the world faster than it had ever imagined. I would rule as a god teaching people and ruling with respect and fear, I would ensure my subjects live the best life and the smartest work together to help the society. I would keep the strongest and most technologically advanced weapons a secret so that any resistance to my empire can be swiftly crushed. Eventually I would get too old to rule after teaching all that I could’ve in my lifetime and uniting the world under one flag. I went through my glorious capital filled with happy families free of war, poverty, hunger and fear. I would be known as a deity and a fearless leader. I spent a while finding the perfect successor, and teaching him all the information I know and teaching him how to lead us into the future. I relaxed in my towering skyscraper overlooking the gleaming and glistening city that expands beneath me, I think about all the world I have essentially created, one that is held under no limits and one that without me It would thrive. I walk into my bedroom and enter a combination into the wall opening a vast room which inside stands a luxurious star cruiser, entering it I look at the machine that has helped me accomplish all this, I turn and take control, turning on my retirement protocol. The timer on the dashboard starts ticking down, 15... the gate opens 14... the cruiser powers up 13... the engines roar to life 12... I feel the vehicle leap forward 11... Free of the hangar 10... Soaring through the air 9... one last look at my utopia 8...ascending 7... ascending 6... perfect spot 5... the vehicle slows 4... I stare at one last sunset 3... a smile slowly grows upon my face 2... I am now at peace after hundreds of years dedicated to this place 1... I close my eyes as I am now at peace 0... The air itself seems to melt as everything within the ship disintegrates and then expands in flaming streams of color. Children in the many parks look in awe as the sky lights up with beautiful streaks of light fly through the air slowly disappearing into the sky, and as the light fades from me, a light grows bright inside of them, a light of imagination and creativity.

>  Go back to 1994 to tell my mom I love her before she dies

>  Travel back to the appropriate dates and places to prevent accidental deaths of Buddy Holly, Jim Morrison, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn and Prince. 

Then Sarajevo June 1914 to do better job driving a certain  Archduke's limousine. 

Then 1600 London to watch some plays and observe possibly meet Shakespeare and just look at that time.

I would love to go back to the first Council of Trent to try to head off the Counter-Reformation, but I'm not sure I could ever accomplish much.

I would like to be in Corinth in around 30ish AD to see Paul evangelize and of course go to Galilee to see Jesus face to face. 

I might go back in 100 to 500 year jumps in one city (like Jerusalem or Rome or Paris) just to observe how these places developed.

Australia around 50K years ago to try to prevent mass extinction of megafauna.

Then, wherever.

>  I go back to right before Hitler tried to apply to art school so that I can convince them to let him in, preventing the world wars

>  I think all the “go back and meet/interact with x famous person “ posts are funny because there are plenty of powerful or interesting people most of us would like to meet that are alive RIGHT NOW but it’s too hard to get an audience with them. Why would we be any more capable of interacting with famous people from the past?

>  Here are the following people I would go back in time and talk to in depth:

Julius Caesar

Augustus Caesar 

Emperor Trajan

Cleopatra 

Sun Tzu

Queen Elizabeth 

Guan Yu

Queen Zenobia 

Emperor Aurelian 

Adolf Hitler

King Leonids 

George Washington 

Abraham Lincoln 

And Leonardo DaVinci

>  I go back and meet your mom 9 months before you were born. Me and her enjoy 3 cups of coffee together at your local coffee shop. She drinks 2 and i only 1, im not that big on coffee. We later go to the local park talk about the meaning of life and the reason for people wanting kids, and if kids are necessary at all. We both have opposing views, but it doesnt turn into an argument, we change the subject to avocado toast. As our conversation hits the peak of interest of each other, we slowly walk back to my car. On the way back its quiet but calm. I drop her off at her place and ask if i can come up for another cup of coffee. She tells me, “but you don’t drink coffee.” I tell her, “no, no i do not..... so lets drink some coffee anyways.” She invites me in. We dont drink coffee.  Next, its 9 months later you’re born.

>  I'd go back and kill all the biggest killers, Hitler, Stalin and what not, then I would somehow solve world peice, climate change and all the world's problems and then settle down going on adventures throughout time.

>  Step 1:Go back to 0 BC  
Step 2:Ride Dinosaurs  
Step 3:?????  
Step 4:Become God Emperor of Mankind

>  Go back to the day I would’ve been conceived and stop that.

>  I would go kill that Abraham dude, should solve a bunch of problems.

>  I would take Hitler right before he killed himself, go back to the present and cut his balls off and make he uses it to drink water while I tell him how he failed to win the war.

>  I go back in time to the first person that types "first" in a comments thread because they think they are the first person to post something there. 
I'll pop up behind you. Right before you hit send, if you are with other people, I'll put a bullet in your head and dip out. 
If you are alone. I'll sneak up behind you string you up with piano wire for a more personal interaction and satisfaction.

But that's the thing. After I do that. Surely some time in the future, someone else is going to think it would be important to state that they are "first". Poof, there I am to stop a plague from infecting every comment board on the internet. Thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives would eventually be extinguished. However it will be a constant never-ending battle I would be proud to carry on.  Some bright day in the future; people will be shunned in the act of unoriginal, copy paste comments, enough to qwell the infection without me having to do my sworn duty.

>  Go to the far future, steal a shit ton of weapons go back to present time. Rule the world

>  Go back to before the Big Bang, replicate a massive bomb(s) and boom, now I’m god creator of all.

>  Go back 1.5 million years ago, show off modern technology, become a god-like king among the Hominidae.

>  I would sleep in the time machine, go back to when I started sleeping and use all my 24 hours. None of this bullshit where I waste 8 hours of my day... also use that matter replicator to create food for my family so all our income can be used to pay rent and all the extra money goes to saving. Don’t replicate the money, obviously would destroy the economy.

I don’t want to go back in time. Maybe so I can study for tests... maybe.

I go back to the original timeline to let timeline2 fall apart while im on vacation then builing it back for fun.

>  Is there also a decontamination room and sick bay? Because if you go very far forward or back you would be exposed to all kinds of diseases and illnesses as well or you could be the guy that infects humans with the cold, flu, etc.

>  Back to some point in time when I could buy stock in Amazon/Google/Microsoft etc.

>  Four years back in time so I can see my childhood cat again

>  4 dates. 

First, the day of the coal mine collapse that took my dads fathers leg. 

Second, the day my dads father took the shitty advice about his prostrate cancer from his garbage doctor. Which eventually led to his death. 

Third, when my moms father got cancer in his lymph nodes on the right side of his neck. I’d tell him that he needs to go to the hospital to get checked out and have it removed. Also, to go to the hospital whenever he needed to because I’d very much like to get to know him seeing as he died when I was 5. 

Fourth and final, I’d go back to early August that just passed and tell my friend to go to the hospital because he doesn’t have the flu, it’s bacterial pneumonia and he has an undiagnosed heart condition that ended up killing him. He was 28.

>  Travel back to the time right before the burning of Alexandria, and save that shit.

I would need to allow 9/11 to happen so a grandfather paradox doesn't happen because I only exist because of it because I was born exactly 9 months after to the day. I would go back to 1913 Vienna and provide funds for Sigmund Freud to start a support group for free thinkers. This would end up fixing many real world issues. Then, I would convince Hiroshi Yamauchi to keep its' deal with Sony AND Philips from the start, (plus Panasonic later on, then Sega, both as normal here in this timeline) in the spirit of the Red Book to create the most humorous way of power. Then, to stop Microsoft, I would convince Tramiel not to jump companies but to instead merge the Atari and Commodore lines, before obeying the USA NES Atari deal to make Tengen Tetris official, give the NES BCD in the cpu, and then make the NES APU support expansions in US copies. Then I would allow some co-releases. Also, I would replicate lost protos and money. Then I would save artifacts and dupe them. Same for files by low level drive cloning. Then I would buy EVERYTHING proto and dump it after lobbying via exorbitant amounts of cash to disable copyright and I would duplicate votes for clinton. I would then duplicate Beta build discs, lost media, the rarer hardware such as Playstation proto, and literally everything else.

>  It can replicate money. Go to the (as far as possible) future where paper money is still good, buy all the newest tech and other modern things I might want, and bring them back. I would say sell them for a fortune, but I have infinite money. Just enjoy them I guess

>  I would go back in time to when they would kill you for literally anything and replicate myself, then I would make my copy say something offensive so my copy gets killed. Then do it again and again until I’m famous and come back now.

>  I would go to the 1940s when 4 megabites was the size of beds and show them a 64 gigabit sd card.

>  I'd wanna go back in time and tell 3rd grade me it will get better and suicide is NEVER and option and that you have to stick up for yourself.

>  Well first things first I’d go to my local bookstore and pick up a copy of Grays Sports Almanac 1950-2000. Then I’d go back to the 50s and bet my way to an empire. I’d use that money to build a hotel and casino and spend all my time there.

>  Back to when i was 14 so i can be happy again

>  I would go to the person who was about to invent the education system (school) and stab the shit out of him(:

>  Prevent Stalin, make sure Trotsky gains power and then can actively pursue his ideals without the Nazis, Japanese or Allies undermining or interfering.

Document the results on video, then go back and stop myself, and instead do the same for Hitler.  Document the results, then go back and do the same for the Empire of Japan. Then do the same for Napoleon. Then do the same for the British, preventing the secession of the 13 colonies. Then do the same for the African continent preventing the trans-atlantic slave trade. Then prevent any travel to the Americas and document how the Americas would have developed without interference. Then see what happens if the Mongol Empire endures, and the Macedonian Empire, and the Roman Empire, the Persian Empire, the Delian League, the Cambodians. Document it all.

Then reset everything, bring all the documentation back here and publish everything. Let the world see what could have been.  See what they do with that information.  Don't actually change anything in the end. Just let people know what could have been, and see if/what they change for themselves.

>  Go back to 5th grade and tell my self to man up and stop being a pussy

>  I go back to the Roman Empire and matter replicate an airplane.

>  I would go a week ago to different countries and so would travel

>  I go back in time, kill my mom in her crib and cause the universe to enter an infinite loop. Enjoy your pre-IT decades playing over and over and over, just like groundhog day.

>  It would be interesting to go back to Israel in like 1 AD and watch the whole Jesus thing play out.  See what the deal is with all those miracles people were writing about.

>  Assuming I have a way to also make myself not carry deadly diseases, I'd go back in time like 600 years around the Northeast United States.  One of my fantasies is being able to completely withdraw from everything to live in nature whenever I need to just to get a break from everything and maybe even work on something. The Northeast US specifically only because I live around there and it'd still feel a little familiar despite much of the landscape being very different.

>  Go back in time and eat this burger again

>  I would go back to stop trump

>  Does our body go back into the one we had at the time? If so then back a few months to reverse a thing that happened to me. If not then back 6 months to watch videos on Youtube that were copyright striked for no apparent reason.

>  I go to dinosaur times and save a bunch of them and see what happens if they survived the meteor. Or, i would still go to dinosaur times, but this time i would make an army of dinosaurs and use them to fight evil and stuff, like a dinosaur hero army. That’d awesome

>  Go back before the Egyptians first started building the pyramids and when they start just basically make them exactly where they are today and this will be my way of messing with people and do the same thing with stone henge and easter island so people think that it was these ancient people did these great things but Haha wrong it was future man

>  I would go back to invent PornHub.

>  I'd go back in time at the moment of my birth, shoot my mother in the head (the bitch deserves it for all the abuse she put me through) and then raise myself, watch myself grow, and guide myself to repeat the same actions I took when I went back in time.

>  I would go get the mother 3 n64 prototype and bring it back to the present for it to be sold and leaked online

>  First place I’d go would be to bible times to confirm my religious beliefs, then Dinos, then 50’s, then buy bitcoin when it’s fractions of a penny, then as far into the future as I can go where life is still viable on earth to see if humans progressed or regressed. Also use the cloaking device to go to WW1 and WW2 to see what the soldiers truly went through

>  What do you mean 'go'? That sounds like a rent-free apartment to me. Why would I 'go' anywhere?

>  First I would go to see how the seven wonders of ancient world looked like an right after how Constantinopole looked like when it was still roman and then byzantine

>  Id go back to Nov of 1963 to stop JFK from starting war with Russia.

>  As far forward as I can until I find the point at which the zombie apocalypse happens. Find a zombie, make it harmless by cutting off the jaw or whatever, take off its arms and legs so it has to wiggle worm in order to move, then go back to present day and put it in my best friend’s ex’s closet. Fuck him. Shouldn’t kill him, but rather scare 50 years off his life.

>  Gonna go back in time and see what Qualuudes were all about

>  Personally me, I would love to be through the 19th and early 20th century. (The Victorian era) and just travel around the world through time one event/place at a time. But if I had to chose the first location. It would be a tie between London 1890 (UK),  Houston 1840 (the Republic of Texas) or 1913 (USA), Berlin 1880 (Imperial Germany), or Tokyo 1900 (Japan).  But I would primarily go through major events such as German unification under Prussia, the Meiji restoration, The beginning of the Roaring Twenties, and finally The Great War (Aka: World War 1). I would love to see how the culture, technology, and way of life was back then was so different to how it was now. I personally think it’s fascinating.

>  Go back to the beginning of time and figure out which origin belief is correct.

>  Head out and find Hitler as a child, then I would take his god darned self outside of time and make him into a better person with respect for everyone, eventually releasing him back to his time to do good in the world, then I would go find every other human who has done something terrible and slowly tip the world to be a better place.

>  Honesty, my first destination would probably just be 10 years into the past. No specific reason really. I just think going back to re experience what everything was like and the memories I could remember from that time.

>  Go back to 2016 and fix some paperwork that I made a mistake on(I accidentally put I did not file taxes in 2016) which is biting me hard core in the butt rn. All because of a "yes/no" question. It's literally costing me thousands, when is should have been $0

>  I would go to Berlin in 1941 to join my favorite side

Wait your telling me Jojo isn't real?
*looks at matter replicator*
It is now bitch

>  (Sorry for my bad English in advance) I would go back to 1930's Estonia to see the beautiful towns of Narva and Ivangorod, to see how they looked like before the bombing during ww2. I'd also gather as much intel on the old republic as i possibly could.

>  I would go back in time and do my life better. And hopefully be able to save my parents

>  I would go check out places like Machu Pichu, Angkor Wat, and Egypt pyramids at their heydays. 

Basically go as far back as possible, to the early civilizations.

>  If it could travel in time? I wouldn't use it, i would just get some money and farm the matter replicator. If it could move in space time? I would go 25 years into the future and do the same. When ive consumed enough media i will go forward another 25 years and repeat until we have time travel completed in practice by someone other than myself then i would sell the schematics of my time machine and use the money to build a colonization ship. By then we should be able to map the human brain. I will upload myself to the mainframe of my ship. Then i, a respected and rich scientists/physysist of the world, will file applications to the fittest, the healthiest, the most athletic people of the world. The people who accept the application will be taken to the ship, have their conscious uploaded into a separate storage apart of the mainframe and then put their consciousness into a dormant state, while in turn preserving the bodies using the best of modern technology. Once i have a few hundred thousand people into my colony's ship i will set off into space and put myself into autopilot, so that i would awaken only when something goes wrong. In this autopilot there will be a separate AI always active with the purpose of keeping the ship clean and repairing the ship. It will also map out possible candidates to where we are heading. We will be going to the Andromeda galaxy. After we arive i will come out of autopilot and traverse space time to look for a planet suitable for human colonization. Once find one i will land, set some basic structures up and boot the humans back into their bodies. I will coppy myself in my original body while having my AI self still in the mainframe. The ai will help with the prosperity of new civilization and i will live as a hermit enjoying my new life of peace and tranquility. If there is sentient life i would like to engage in peaceful relations with them, i would love to get some alien pussy.

>  Go back in time to hang out with Alan Watts. Then stop in to meet Carl Sagan

>  1107. I would go back to when thw christian crusades started against baltic people, in real history the war lasted 137 years bwcause germans were far stronger but baltics were way more stubborn and would level fortresses and churches brick by brick to get back.i would teach them to build armor, weapons, forts, tame horses and teach few tactics to crush the german crusaders in humilating defeat by the last pagans of the europe.

>  I would probably go back to the first embarrassing moment I remember and fix the hell out of it

>  I would only go back to the early evening of July 18th, 2019 to before my fiancée's youngest sister made the decision to go with some guy to a convenience store in a Corvette and tell her not to get into the car because she would not make it more than 1 block before she was killed.

That's all I want - to stop that day from happening and bringing joy back to her family, and stop the pain I feel every day because we all miss her.

>  I would go back in time and kill Stalin, Gorbachev, and prevent Viktor Tsoi's(Soviet Rockstar)  death.

>  1. Take some money, say 1000$, deposit it in a good bank when this amount meant a LOT. Also, buy some stuff i know is gonna be expensive in the future. Also buy some land, since my current money would make me a millionaire there. Come back to the present, and withdraw my savings, sell the land and the antiques. Since the value would have largely increased, i would become damn rich. Then repeat till i become a millionaire.
2. It would be fun going back in time and solving unsolved mysteries, like that jack the ripper dude, since i know where he will strike next.
3. Go reallly back in time to see if gods existed in Earth. Say, greek mythology maybe.

>  Future, not too far tho. Around the time of the next election. See who wins.  Depending on that depends if I just go back to my time or if I continuously go through the 2000 - 2019 time period.

>  I take vinyl of a bunch of bangers, go back to a top tier nightclub in the 70’s and DJ for one night.

People in the club that night would be wondering what song they heard that night for decades and then when they hear them on the radio over the years it would slowly dawn on them that they witnessed time travel.

>  I would go back to any arguments I had and whisper into my past-self’s ear everything I thought of saying after the argument.

>  I would go back to Friday and fix the relationship I fucked up

>  I would go back in time to all the greatest events that took place and just observe them. I wouldnt do anything to affect the current event, just watch and obtain the answers and ill keep them with me for eternity. So that I can rest easy knowing all the unknown events that took place in history. But what events? Roswell UFC crash, JFK assassination, 911 beginning and end (like who did it and organized it) Amelia Earhart disappearance.

>  Go back to the dinosaur era, right before the meteor  hits, and just watch it come towards earth and then I die.

>  ok, yes. i think about this all the time. i have no idea where i would go first though. i’m pretty fascinated by the first humans/early humans and how they adapted to their environment to survive. so maybe one of the first civilizations in all of the world. the 1500s would also be cool though. mostly to see if all the kings and queens look anything like their paintings tbh.

>  I'd bring a scientist, historian and a trained bodyguard that knows how to blend in with each time and study the logic of time travel, then when we fully understand time travel, i'd meet einstein, epstein, JFK and talk to them and go back to the present and show my findings on how the fuck i did time travel and learnt all the dumb nerd shit of what to do and what not to do so as to not fuck around with the time line

>  As boring as this may kinda be (compared to say going back to see the pyramids be made or something like that) I’d go back to the 60s or 70s to see a bunch of concerts of artists and bands I love. I’d also go shopping.

>  Go back in time 10 trillion years and take a piss and dump.

>  Why would I go anywhere? Sounds like a sweet setup.

>  First place I would go is the bathroom.. so I could think better

>  Go back to 100 years ago, so no one can trace me. Use Wikipedia to seek famous attractive women at that time. 
Use cloaking device, attack women, use matter replicator to replicate their body. 
Use the bedroom to fuck their replicated body all days, after i get bored, kill that body, dump it at some random place 200 years ago. And repeat the process.

>  I would get horny, go back in time to when I was horny earlier, then spit roast my woman. If she wasn'r down to clown, I'd 69 myself. If you timeblow yourself and swallow it's basically infinite cum loops!

>  Go back and get the Queen to abort Prince Andrew so there's at least one less massive nonce in the world!!

>  If I could figure it out, I'd go to the day of my funeral (because I'd make sure the body was never found) so I can run in and yell "Sorry, I'm late!" And jump into the casket, then go back to present day.

>  I'd go back in time to get some cream n cheesey  Nik naks, Doritos 3Ds, some old Cadburys dairy milk before Kraft bought em out and visit my favourite fish and chip shop that closed down in 2003... They did gorgeous chip butties...

Yeah I'd probably just be a time traveling stoner with the perma munchies for food I can't get any more tbh

>  I go back to a few years ago when Warren Buffet offered a billion dollars to whoever got the March Madness bracket completely right and get my money!

>  I would go back in time in relatively small increments so that I could gradually learn the changes in societal values, attitudes, and sensibilities. I think if I tried to jump back hundreds of years all at once, then I would seem obviously out of place and draw too much attention.

>  I would go back roughly 2000 years and see what kind of debauchery Jesus was really up to

>  I'd go back to the beginning of the industrial revolution and drop off a bunch of modern mechanical/electrical engineering books and watch the world grow

>  Bruh.. This is a bit contrived, but i'd go back in time, try to alter the pass to where i'm born a women, thus creating an alternate timeline, then pick her up when she's an adult so we could travel through time together as fuck buddies. Sounds stupid, but no one knows or loves you better than you and the only thing this room doesn't provide is good company and sex...

>  Go back to jesus' time and do his mushrooms with him.

>  I would go to mars right at the time when earth dies

>  Go back to the points in time that every major religion transcribed their first boobs. I'd plop down some scientific data, nothing so far advanced to completely screw humanity up, but enough that civilization would lean on science more than religion. 

I'd also find the scientists who created nuclear weapons and destroy all their research before they could create them. Same with the inventors of pistols. 

Give me a future without religious wars and weapons. 

I'd also go back just a bit and push medical science along further so that we had an even better grasp on some modern day medical issues we have now.

>  Go back to when I was in my emo faze and slap my younger self while I tell them to get over their emo Arise "not like other people" bullshit

>  Is it against the rules to interact with people as a time traveler? The very first thing I would do is go back to 6 or so years ago. Before my dad got cancer. I guess just to spend more time with him. 

There are so many other more conventional historical things I would want to see, but I still think about seeing him again almost every day. Everything else would wait :)

>  I would go to acient rome and watch some gladiator fights

>  So basically this is all contingent on what kind of physics exists for time travel.

**Is it John Titor Time Travel?** In this version, the further you travel back/forward in time takes you further away from your actual timeline. So say you want to go back/forward 1 year, you end up in a timeline more similar to your actual timeline than if you were to go back/forward 25 years. You might try to go back in time to kill hitler, but instead of shooting himself in a bunker, maybe he was assassinated in a completely different place instead.

**Splinter Timeline?** This is closer to a “linear” timeline, except that when you go back and time and change something, you just end up creating a completely new splinter timeline, and you eaither cant get back to your own timeline, or you go back to your timeline and it’s completely unaffected by your change.

**Linear Timeline** This assumes time flows in a straight line, and if this were the case I feel like the possibility of multiverses is impossible, because the future would be completely affected by whatever changes you make in the past.

**4th Dimensional Time** This is when time is considered the fourth dimension, and all times are running concurrently. Like, every point in time actually exists at the same time. Like right now you’re sitting here reading this thread on reddit, and Christ is being crucified, and man is landing on the moon, and the first major City on Jupiter just celebrated its bicentennial, and the Big Bang just happened, and the heat death of the universe just happened. 

Personally, the 4th Dimension Physics model of time is the one I personally prescribe to, and I feel like in that one, no matter what you do while traveling through time, it has no affect on any point in time, because it’s all happening at once. 

*That being said*, what I would do is:
1. Go to the year 3000, and see if Earth is still around, and see if there is some type of Wikipedia, or Supercomputer type device that can teach me anything I need to know.
2. Travel back to when Pangea was still around, and check out what Earth looked like back in its infancy.
3. Check out some motherfucking dinosaurs.
3. Check out the interaction between early Homo Sapiens and Neanderthals. Explore their cultures.
4. Go through the various Empires and see how they actually worked, the Mayans, Aztecs, Egyptians, Plains Indians, see if Atlantis existed, the Greeks, Romans, Trojans
5. Check out the Punic Wars and see Hannibal at his greatest, the same with Alexander the Great, and many other classical Generals and the wars they fought.
6. Experience the Historical Jesus, even if it’s just to see His Face and hear His Voice. 
7. Experience some of the Great Wars, the American Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WW1&2, etc.
8. Check out the Moon Landing, and go to the future and check out the first Mars Landing, and other future space flight things.

Dude I could seriously go on forever. I honestly feel like the past would be interesting mostly because we already know a lot of what has happened, the real adventure would be in going to the future to find out what *will* happen.

>  I would record historical events and upload them to YouTube. Stuff like the pyramids and stone henge being built. People would go nuts trying to work out how the CGI was so good.

>  Unless it has a built in method of motivation you're not going anywhere. Secondly, you are only going into the future and then you can only go back as far as the point in time from which you left.

>  I go to bed

>  Honestly? I'd just go back in time to a week or two before my buddy Brian passed away. I've wondered how he'd feel about how much I've changed, and he was very open minded towards the end. It'd be great to have some closure on that, though I know I never really will.

>  I would go back in time to ask reddit where/when would they go first.

>  I'd go back to when the battle of Jhansi 1857. So that such a brave freedom fighter doesn't have to face betrayal from her own people and her heir doesn't have to grow up dirt poor because his rightful money was stolen by the East India Company.

>  Back to before my dad completely worn out his back through work so I could somehow stop him from doing it.

>  1. Go back in time to see and meet all the people in my life that I never really got to meet because I was little when they died 2.Go see any historical moment happen 3. Go back to tell myself that cutting is a really bad idea 4. Stop myself from getting into bad relationships 5. Go in the future to see how my life ends out to see if I can improve it (also to see if I get married at all)

>  Go back, oh I dunno, maybe 2000 years ago? The Middle East looks kinda chill

>  Go back in time and shoot hitler... just before he shot himself. That way I could get the satisfaction but also not change history too much

>  I go to like 1965 and start making money hand over fist and put it in a trust or IRA or buy bonds for myself, and then to like 1990. Forget ancient Rome or whatever. I live very comfortably, on a very nice piece of coastal property in the 90's and 2000's.

Maybe I go back to some earlier date and kill child Trump. Or like his grandfather or dad or something.

>  I’d go back in time and be the first one to write ‘Call me Maybe’.

>  Go back & spectate dinosaurs before going to check out some ancient civilizations.

>  I would go back 300,000 years and teach the first anatomically modern men everything we currently know about agriculture, metallurgy, architecture, biology, chemistry, physics, etc. I would tell them to find a humane way to never exceed a total world population of 2 billion. I would make sure they understand how the greenhouse effect could turn earth into Venus if they aren't careful. I'd relay the importance of not destroying the rainforests and jungles of the world. And I would tell them I came from a future where I was the last human alive because humanity didn't follow the guidelines I laid out for them and in the future I came from the earth is almost as barren a wasteland as Mars.

>  I do everything in my power to prevent the fall of the Sound dynasty. Then I go back to the future and see what timeline I just made. Then I probably just go back again and make sure it falls.

Just for fun, I’d go back and make sure I was photographed in prominent events of history, enough so that speculation arose of an immortal out there somewhere by the time I returned to my own time.

Using their faith, i would then advise the leaders with my knowledge in order to help them avoid the huge mistakes of humanity(The Persian-Eastern Rome wars, the burning of the Library of Alexandria, the destruction of the Babylonian Hanging Gardens etc.) And voila!

>  I'd say it's obvious, you have to make plans:
Arm yourself with a paper and pen, hum your way through every Top 40 hit since the hit parade started and make a list

Learn all the words, remember the tunes.
Make sure you have it all written down.
Set the dial to where you're heading to, the year before Elvis: 1952

Now, welcome to your alternative life.
You are the king of rock and roll, insurmountably high.
You have the songs, you are the king of radio.
You preempt every fashion like you knew exactly which way to go

It just seems to be effortless.
The way you write them in ten minutes or less.
And bitter nobodies can't explain how you took their inner secrets and spewed them out your mouth before they could write them down.

But wait a minute, seriously, wait a minute.
This has happened before, I swear this has happened before.
There were those two weird kids from Liverpool, they came out of nowhere...
Wait a minute, John and Paul something...

Paul McCartney and John Lennon came back from a different future armed with notebooks filled up with songs stolen from kids who now stay at home

Mark Chapman was sent back in time to assassinate John Lennon. 
Paul is left but the questions is
Who will be the T-1000?

Keith Richards!
Think about it!
He can't be killed!
He will not die!
Keith Richards!
Keith Richards is a T-1000

Watch your back, Paul
Seriously, man
Watch your back

>  I’m assuming that there’s some kind of transportation device aswell, so I wouldn’t have to get around with my huge time machine on foot.

First I would go through history to find missing data, like what was in Greek fire or who killed JFK. I would collect all the data and edit the damn wiki pages myself. (Even if it’s just me who can see it)

Then I would go back to like the Middle Ages in Denmark and I would conquer a small piece of land using gunpowder or a machine gun. I would make my peasants semi free, and instating my own government, where they’re forced to learn the same as we do today. I would then make it a secret society and help them to wealth beyond imagination. Then they would become a shadow council, that I would visit 50 years at a time through history, trying to shape them into knowledge gatheres. 

After hundreds of years, they should be at a level of knowledge, beyond my own, and I would help them further their sciences, to better the future!

>  I would screw with a random wiki page, go back in time and see how accurate I can make the wiki page.

I'd also like to have an areal view of pangaea before it became the counties we now know. Just seems cool.

But then I figure, if you're gonna change things, why not go big? The biggest problem through history, as far as I see it, is the primacy of the powerful and murderous over everyone else. So I go waaaay back, like 7,000BCE, and foster a fledgeling empire. I pop back in every few years for a couple of days to keep things on track and keep their technology superior to those around them, and to guide their philosophy towards peace and stewardship of nature. Historically, such peaceful groups were easily subjugated, but my guys always seem to have an inexplicable military advantage. I bring photovoltaics and electricity in early and we skip the whole fossil fuels thing. If I drop in for one day every year, thirty years of my life would span 10,000 years of empire.   


Maybe it would just end up fucking things up in different ways, but it seems like it would be worth a shot.

>  Go back in time and kill hitler

>  Go back in time a prevent the rise of Christianity thus preventing events like the burning of the Library of Alexandria (this single event set human knowledge and understanding back over 1000 years). This would prevent the dark ages and the loss of over 90% of ancient learning imagine how much further humanity would be in our understanding of the world around us plus no crusades they were fucked up. Notice how Islam is excluded that's because the classical knowledge that has survived only did so cause it was translated into Arabic by Muslim Scholars then translated into European languages during the Renaissance.

>  Go back to the renaissance/ 1700s and become a huge musical ‘genius’ playing ‘revolutionary’ songs that are actually just modern ones and your the world, ‘performing’ for all sorts of people but also leave odd bits of evidence around that will make no sense to historians who find them in the future.

I'd also go back in time to different times to try and bring peace to the world.

Also idk maybe fuck Cleopatra or Joan of Arc

>  Find out who jack the ripper was

>  Back to exactly 2 weeks ago, November 16th. I flew down to spend a week with the girl of my dreams in Arizona, but the day before I left she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship and I've been depressed since. So I guess I'd just relive those first 6 days forever.

>  I'd love to go to 2001 when my dad had to migrate to another country because we were starving at ours and I was left with my narcissistic mom and grew all kinds of insecurities and developed an incredibly low self esteem that still influences my adulthood. I would find my 12 years old me and would give me support, help at school, advice, love, hugging, and will try to make her / me understand that she's a worthy human being that needs no validation from anyone else. I would also advice me on learning to show love to loved ones, since I grew up lacking mom's love demonstration, and so that dimension's "me" can hug and tell my grandparents and aunts how much I love them, and listen to their stories and advice, and make better and healthier decisions. I would tell me to be nicer to my younger sister and demonstrate love to her and enjoy her childhood, not being jealous of her at how my mom is nicer to her and grow up as best friends from a very young age.
You know, just for the fun.

>  Beginning of high school... Spend as much time with my dad, not cutting him off every time to hang with friends, not knowing how fragile his goddamn life was, never getting pissed at him for just asking me to go a fucking movie & listening to his advice. Maybe if I wasn't such an ungrateful bastard of a kid, I would have never have become so fucking depressed when he died.

>  To the stock exchange, so I could be super rich.

>  Talk to Jesus about my de ja vu dreams... ever since I was a kid, I've had dreams about my future, and they started coming true in high school, and have been coming true ever since. I'm still having more dreams, and will occasionally repeat dreams. I never remember them when I wake up, and only know I'm still having them because I'll have them come true just a couple weeks later on occasion, though usually it's at least a year or two.

>  # Ok, Doctor Who.

>  Back to the time around when Jesus Christ/Yeshua/Yahweh was conceived and take DNA samples from \_everybody\_ in town, then wait around till the so-called Son of God was born, and take samples from him and the three wise men.  
Someone's gotta pay for this 2000-year-old cult.

>  see how bad the Idiocracy gets

>  I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

>  Far enough into the future to a time where humanity has found a way to transfer (not copy) one's consciousness into a digital form where we live as gods of our own virtual worlds that are so realistic that they're indistinguishable from reality. Time could easily be sped up millions-fold inside the simulation (IE thousand years in simulation is only a single day IRL type situation). I'd effectively become immortal and invincible in my own eternal paradise.

If yes, back and forth in time for lotto numbers and be the first person to win multiple lottery drawings.

>  I go to fuck hitlers mom just before her husband comes in to do the same. She’ll be left on the streets with a small child that isn’t Hitler and will most likely die of a curable disease. So WWII never happened

>  Who cares. "First" no longer applies.

>  Back in 1907 to force the art school to accept Hitler so he doesn't become a crazy maniac and start ww2

>  I love the story of the fall of the Romanov’s. It’s always been my favorite part of history. I’d start there and use the cloaking device to see what really happened to Anastasia. 
From there. Follow hitler. See what really happened at his time of death.  
Visit a Martin Luther king rally. Go to the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. Bring my iPhone with me so I can make a time lapse of Leonardo da Vinci creating masterpieces. Visit a New York bar during the 70’s/80’s when the Irish and Italian mafias were tearing each other apart. 

There’s so many options especially with the cloaking device.

Who were the people we read about in books?

I miss her

I also wanted to meet Marcus Aurelius to learn Stoicism and the precepts of the Pax Romana which would evolve to the league of Nations and soon follows the United Nations. I wanted to meet all the grandchildren of Queen Victoria before they all go to war with each other. I also want to have a nice chat with King John while he wrote the Magna Carta, and witness the start of the plague that would annihilate most of Europe at the port of Messina, and witness the 12 death ships dock from the black sea.

One "president" rules until he dies then another dictator just takes his place.

if i could redo any event in history with a matter replicator and a wikipedia article i would visit europe before black death with penicillin and an article about immunizations. that knowledge would have saved 200 million lives in eurasia and millions of native american people after the first explorers reached the americas.

>  I tend to think of this as a time passer but, I would go to roughly 995 CE in pre-Columbian north america.


I've got a large sketchbook filled with plenty of useful information ranging from metallurgy, chemistry, engineering, math and even a bit of languages. Everything from native mineral deposits and agricultural practices to early steam machines and electricity.


It would give me roughly 5 years to travel, trade, and establish myself amongst the first Nations and prepare a good stockpile for trade when the Vikings visit l'anse aux meadows in 1000 CE , afterwords I would form a community of both first Nations and Norse and slowly build up my empire over the years, establishing trade with Europe for things like rare metals and spices.

No plan to become a god or rule the world, just be the first to lay the bricks in a new civilization. And see how much I can create with the little materials I have.

Since it has a matter replicator, I'm going to need a universal translator. I'll also need a disguise.

>  The highest point overlooking the battle of Cannae, to watch Hannibal kick Rome's arse. Then a whole bunch of other battles after that. How did the battle of Thermopylae really go down? How close to Darius did Alexander really get at the battle of Gaugamela? How close to winning was Napoleon at Waterloo before the Prussians saved the day? So many questions...

>  Joe mamma

>  Eh, I'd probably go visit my grandmother and talk to her before she died and murder my (now dead) grandfather (my grandfather abused my grandmother, raped his stepdaughters, and beat his kids- fucker deserved to live a short life rather than live until the ripe age of 90 like he did).  Probably not in that order, if I take out my grandfather around 1980 there's a fairly good chance my grandmother would still be alive today as she primarily died because he wouldn't let her manage her diabetes.  So maybe just kill my grandfather and return to the present and take my grandmother out shopping.

>  First, go back to that day in 1988 when I applied to college and mark the box for Computer Engineering. Then hire some MIB looking dudes to visit my parents and have them swear a patriotic oath, sign some agreement of silence, and retract their adamant statements that computer engineering is ‘a stupid career idea that has no future’ . 

So basically undo what I regret most not doing... 

And then play the market wisely, cuz we all like some breathing room in our bank account.

When the rich support the arts the world just flourishes. Now all the buildings are ugly.

>  solve the mystery dissapearences

>  Is it even a question? Jesus, obviously. But then the irony there is that, according to my religious beliefs, God would probably prevent me from time traveling, since belief is supposed to rely on faith and not true knowledge.

>  Back 12,000 years to the observe the Later Dryas, as depicted in the oral history known as the book of Revelation... watch the sea level rise 200 feet, take lots of videos, maybe save a lot of people with warnings ahead of time, or at least my good buddy Noah and his kin.

Can I ffwd? Cause I'd do it from 476 onwards cause I really can't wrap my head around how we went from the togas of the Roman Empire to the knights of the medieval ages.

>  I know I can go any*when*, but can I go any*where*? Like I'm not just stuck in one location on Earth, but I have the ability to set a time and location? Also, am I confined to the bubble of space-time, or can I roam freely without being noticed? 

Assuming that I can go anywhere, and I can free roam in cloak mode, I'd probably travel back in time to observe various pivotal moments in history, like the signing of the declaration of independence, or to witness the big bang. I'd probably travel to the future just to observe where we, as a species, are headed.

>  Go back to talk to lee Harvey Oswald, before he was assassinated, to ask him why he killed JFK. I just think the circumstances of him killing the president, then being killed himself were really sketchy. Then jack ruby, the guy who killed LHO dying in jail... super sketchy. And also just the bullet trajectory that killed JFK. Okay I’m gonna stop now. But yea I’d talk to lee Harvey Oswald and get some answers:

Thus causing the foreman to place my ggg grandfather's face on the bank and later put on a coin. Then off to the family homestead to track down the Indian woman who one of my ggg relatives married. My family lost contact on that side of our ancestry, other than it being listed as he married a Indian woman. Then probably go watch some old school history like Chariot races and Lion fighting. Then bring it back and track all the stuff Hitler stole and hid. I for sure would want to check out the old myan Temples while they were still full of life. The ching dynasty warriors would be cool to check out too. Basically Bill and Ted traveling. With a sprinkle of personal stuff.

>  I would turn on cloaking, and visit people I don't like at the worst possible time for them. Then I would use the bathroom, and empty the sewage system. The cloaking system is still on, so they just see my poop appear. This might sound easier said than done, and truthfully it might not even work, depending on the size of the time machine, and what kind of toilet waste removal system is actually on it. So another option would be to save poops, then open the door and throw the poops. This way you could be in and out in seconds, and be back to watching the livestream by the time Kanye steps in it.

>  I go to the past. Really far back into the past, somewhere around the thirteenth to the early fifthteenth century, in medieval England, preferably near London, invent Gutenberg's printing press before he does (using wikipedia). I find some bum off the street begging for a living, convince him I'm some great prophet by administering some improvised antibiotics/moldy bread and wash him up to health/make him look less of a lower-class using the bathroom. Then, I go on Wikipedia, find as much dirt on the person in power (PIP) as I can and print small pamphlets containing the important stuff, which would be spread by the spokesman I found on the street. Then, I use Wikipedia to start predicting a bunch of eclipses and adding them to my pamphlets containing dirt on the king. By now, I would have gained a literal cult following, and I use my 'cult' to start spreading of my pamphlets, predicting more eclipses, convincing more 'spokesmen' I was sent by God and gaining an even larger influence. By now, I'm most likely threatening the PIP, with all the dirt and predicting eclipses and such, so I isolate myself and my group away from London. I use antibiotics to cure my people, and start building a community. 

I look at Wikipedia and the links of its citations and invent modern weaponry (like guns!) and return to London. I spread more propaganda, grow my community, arm my people, and set my eyes on London. I look at Wikipedia one last time before I storm London. The PIP, the local nobles, and his vassals doesn't stand a chance to proper military training and modern war tactics. After a successful conquest of the British Isles followed by the one at London, I start changing the country. I make a religion centered around myself, promote education (besides any that would contradict the belief that I am the chosen one) and build infrastructure. My first few spokesmen become my right hands. I would get my hands on both precious metals, food, and weapons, then use my matter replicator. I also ingeniously replicate my replicator multiple times. Most of my workforce is managing the replicators. I would become a large economic AND military power. 


Later, I would outlaw Christianity on purpose so the pope excommunicates me. The equivalent of The Crusades would most likely happen, and if they didn't, I would just start a war anyways. I would have an invasion of France and Normandy with the same success of the British Isles, for basically the same reasons. I use my same printing press tactics I used in London to convince most of France that I'm the great chosen one and integrate my religion and culture in France and slaughter the heretics. I make France England v2.0, outlaw Christianity, and slowly annex the entire country and establish some spheres of influence over the Holy Roman Empire (HRE). Instead of invading the HRE,  I establish some puppet leaders in some large duchies and let them revolt for my cause. After reinventing airplanes, I airlift these leaders the supplies they need to take over the HRE, and successfully start a revolution. After killing the royal family, they conveniently let me take alltheir land. With no resistance. Rinse and repeat what I did with France but with the HRE, and now I'm threatening the papacy. I stop at that point with the conquest of Europe though, knowing that there would be too much land to manage. 

I make large technological advancements that I refuse to share with my neighboring countries as they flounder around, unsuccessfully trying to reobtain lost land. Eventually, I reinvent nuclear fission technology, and make power grids for my cities. Following this advancement comes tanks, planes, and hydrogen bombs. At this point I have ~1000 bombs at my disposal, and as a show of power, I bomb the Vatican. Twice. You know what's going to happen next. A few decades later, after when I've taken over Eurasia and most of Africa (those Abyssinians were too strong!), when the entire continent knows my name, I would become very old and have a few months left, so I decide to go out with a bang. Literally. I launch all my hydrogen bombs at once, all aimed for different places in the world, marking the end of humanity and all terrestrial life.

I plan out how I'm going to slowly but surely impart all of human wisdom upon the species. I give myself as many vaccines as I can, I mean I have a head start on the 'natives' but no point rolling the dice without them. In fact factor in vaccinating my chosen tribe/people to, dunno, it's a conundrum between saving them from avoidable deaths and giving humanity the longer term ability to develop natural inherent immunities which sadly requires some fatalities over the generations. 
I don't envy the choice tbh. 

I assume the OP has a similar idea otherwise whith the wikipedia?

My main gripe is that I'd have to rely on wiki and couldn't access the actual sources, but I'd try my best with what we have. 

It'd all probably go tits up and be lucky to leave a mystery for conspiracy theorists or even archeologists, but I'd want to jump-start humanity's climb to civilization as early as possible. 

In the grand scheme perhaps it doesn't matter, but still. It seems like the only thing worth doing with that power, otherwise I'd probably take the cloaking and replication tech, give it to humanity of the present day, but only after I have destroyed the time machine and erased as much of it and info about it as possible so no-one else can use it or build one.
No point allowing the absolute space-time destroying hijinks and chaos that giving humanity time travel tech would lead to.

Then, just travel to the early stages of society and teach people about modern science. Bada bing bada boom, industrial revolution thousands of years before it ever happened normally. Also, since I’d have so much knowledge and science, I’d look like a god to early humans, so I’d make them build a religion around me. 

Now we have a world with tons of futuristic technology (I’m sure we’d have flying cars by now if we had gotten a head start earlier on) and everyone obeys my every whim because I’m a god. Yay.

>  I go to 19th century London, where the cloaking device on the time machine gets stuck, making it look like a police box. I then gain the ability to live for thousands of years, regenerating my physical body whenever I am at risk of dying. I realise that I am no longer human, calling myself a Time Lord. I take on the title of “The Doctor” through time and space, recruiting mortal humans to accompany me on my rescue missions and escapades.

>  no where!  I just sit and live in the machine as it sounds like I have everything i need!

>  Into the time machine. I wont go anywhere, just nowhere for some undisturbed sleep.

>  I will first go to the Beginning Of Time and then The End Of Time...

>  Promptly return the TARDIS.

>  Come on, everyone knows the rule: you get a time machine, the first thing you do is kill Hitler.

>  I'm staying in the time machine bedroom.

>  Into the time machine

>  Seems pretty cozy in the time machine, I'll just stay in there.

>  To the beginning

>  I go impress a hooker with my time machine.

>  Just call it the TARDIS...

>  Well if its a time machine cant I go everywhere at every time.

Lemme just see all of it.

>  TO THE BEGINNING!

>  Can I choose where the time machine ends up locationally or will the time machine be stuck in that exact latitude and longitude?

>  Into the time machine.

>  So basically the wave rider from dcs legend of tomorrow?
Anyways I would go to 2040
Some where up north I don’t know where maybe Colorado but I like the cold
And any new tech invented in the next 2 decades would be awesome to use
I won’t need to have home as I have the time machine with all of the essentials save money on bills and shit and any money I need can be obtained by working at Wendy’s if they still exist 

Wendy’s is my favorite fast food place and while a normal person loving on their own would work there I’m not normal
I love in a time machine so I don’t have to pay all those bills and shit
So any money I need can be made working part time at 2040 Wendy’s

>  destroy the time machine, dont wanna start ww3 like in steins gate

>  So I'll be able to ride in a TARDIS

>  If its a time machine that basically a hotel i would go to the start of earth and just set a speed setting on watching everything evolve die evolve live and die while drinking some nice tea.

>  I'd probably just hang out in my time machine. Replicate myself a tv and a playstation and the essentials are covered.

>  Sounds like a TARDIS. Why not the whole universe?

>  Kill you as a baby. Sorry bro but you'll build a time machine that'll rip the space time continuum.

>  The time machine

>  Back to work, that's where I go. I'll sell that time machine and not have an adventure

>  Probably just take a nap in my sweet time machine

>  Tardis, you’re saying?

>  Is this basically asking wwyd with a TARDIS? Because I would watch e v e r y t h i n g. Except for the end of time and the end of planets if it’s too stressing.

>  Just say you have the TARDIS

>  Bathroom. If there’s a bathroom in something as technologically advanced as a time machine, there’s probably one of those nice bathtubs with the jets in there too.

>  [This](https://youtu.be/wPODghAr3Vc) video perfectly explains what should be done if you have a time machine.

>  First I go to the bank in 1857 and rob it, then I go to the bookstore and the grocery store and never come back out of my time machine because I'll never need anything else

>  Forget that, i'm just gonna live in the time machine

>  Jeez that's a lot of neat gizmos on that there time machine. However i may need one more critical component to experience time travel in a  meaningful way..... some sort of propulsion device. Other wise I'm watching history from one location....sweet.

>  Well first of all, I'm gonna need a space suit, since I'm not sure how this time machine works.. 

[Exurb1a has an awesome video about it](https://youtu.be/wPODghAr3Vc)

>  I'm going to go to modern day London and/or Cardiff and hang around far more than you'd expect from somebody with a time machine.

>  There's no reason to ever leave the machine.

>  I'll jump in my TARDIS to Switzerland in 1941.

>  I will use the time machine to get back in 2009 to
prevent my parent from getting groceries. This
will have a chain reaction by stopping my dad
from eating a tomato and choking on it. And 
after that I return in 2019 and have both my parents alive

>  Is the time machine rent-free? Because I'd totally just live in it, hop from place to place in the space of days and vacation like a motherfucker.

>  I'd murder the entire team that created the time machine, their families, their pets, neighbors.  Everyone.  Then I'd destroy the time machine with myself in it.  

Nobody, absolutely nobody should possess this power.

>  So the TARDIS then yeh? Your asking what would you do if you were doctor who?

>  nowhere.

im staying inside the time machine

>  this time machine sounds better than most apartments.

>  A would make a big badass party inside my futuristic time machine with 80s cool disco lights and some hip-hop 2000s gay music with my 1900 cool buddies.

>  Go a second before i got the time machine and it will double the time machine

>  Stay in the time machine, occasionally fuck around with it, maybe improve it so it's more liveable. Invite my friends and family and fuck with history, then go back to our own timeline, then repeat.

>  Whenever the time machine came from. Maybe later so I can get the best possible version of that time machine.

>  Screw the time machine, the matter replicator is what I want

>  The beginning of civilization, Mesopotamians etc and become a god with all the technology available in the time machine

>  In short we have a TARDIS. Well I'll go Doctor Who-ing!!!

>  So you say I have TARDIS? Cool. Future, here I come

>  I just stay in the time machine that shit sounds lit

>  Uh, nowhere. I'm hiding in my time machine!

>  This is a Tardis. Everyone who has seen Dr. Who wants one.

>  Gallifrey and ask them if they've lost a TARDIS

>  Nowhere. I fabricate money, food, a house, a car, and a whole bunch of other stuff like I'm in Minecraft Creative mode and set myself up for the rest of my life. I then turn the time machine into a shed; completely wasting the exploration potential.

>  If I can harvest the cloaking tech off of my time machine, I can become the French espionage man from the game released with the Orange Box in 2007 titled “Team Fortress 2” in Team Fortress 2.

>  So basically TARDIS?

>  To Gallifrey, because that's a Tardis.

>  You mean the TARDIS basically?

>  So it’s basically the TARDIS?

>  I have a healthy poop and a nap in the "time machine", then I go about my day normally.

>  This is like the TARDIS, just cooler.

>  The first experiment would be to matter replicate a mini time machine, wait a day, then send a mouse back to right after the machine was fabricated. I'd introduce both copies of the mouse to each other and watch what happens, especially at the moment of sending. 

Do you honestly think anyone who's worked on computers would trust a brand new computerized invention with their life without watching it do its thing under close supervision for a while first?

>  To the beginning.

>  A Tardis. You have a Tardis.

>  So we all pretty much got our own Tardis lol

>  So basically im given a tardis? I'll be showing it off the first 25 years

>  15 mins in the past and watch myself be given the time machine to make sure it's not some monkey paw bullshit. 

Then

I'd go back a week, park and cloak so I can catch up on rest for the first time this year. Probably wouldnt leave the time machine.

Maybe park it somwhere with a decent view.

>  I’d just chill out in the time machine

>  I might not go anywhere else, that time machine sounds dope inside.

>  You're given a TARDIS basically...

>  I would firstly travel back to when reddit was made and then make every group then i would live in the time machine for how long it survives

>  I would construct the most badass structure of all time around this time machine before doing anything. Like if I can just replicate any sort of matter I want and however much I want, I can basically just make my time machine into a death star. Not to mention I can then start manufacturing those Samsung automated sentry turrets ,now on wheels for convivence, for protection if I ever wanted to leave.

>  Most likely outer space- unless this time machine is also a spaceship, then if I go back in time 200 years then the earth will be 200 years worth of thousand miles a second behind you- ain’t going to work, chief.

>  I’d go to sleep.  No need to rush with a time machine.

>  I'm fuckin going to sleep before the CIA/FBI breaks in my house and tears up my shit trying to find out why there was time machine signals or some shit.

>  Reverse engineer the time machine, then create time machines with bedrooms, bathrooms, cloaking devices and matter replicator through the matter replicator. Then distribute with a link to Wikipedia.

>  So  basically a tardis?

>  Quick question, is this time machine effecting time AND space or just time because than I'm going to have to make a one man helicopter for this trip

>  I just live in the machine and teleport in a food storage place once in a while

>  I go to the day I die and prevent it with some terminator shit because time machines are advanced.

>  Why would I go anywhere? This time machine has everything I need

>  I'll time travel back to this very moment, to update this Reddit post, about what I actually did with the time machine. 

I can hardly think of what I would do if given such a device now!

>  I never leave that room/machine.

>  I have questions. Do any of the things I do affect my current time line, ie killing Hitler alters history etc etc or does it just split a new timeline where Hitler was killed?

Can I take other people in the time machine?

Do I actually have to go anywhere? Can I just go watch the big bang or just chill out with some dinosaurs or go to the end of time and just watch it all collapse over and over again?

>  Into my time machine

>  Wherever I go, the first thing I learned from the time travelling TV show is to hide the time machine properly after reaching the destination 😂

>  Isn’t there going to be an issue with ending up in the middle of space, opening the doors and instantly dying? Time machines are limited to only going forwards or backwards in time, and not changing their location, so the earth would move but the time machine wouldn’t.

What you really need is a TARDIS, then you can really go anywhere, and you can open the doors to have a look out in safety.

>  To the time machine

>  So... Oh fuck... I've lost the time machine, I put it on cloak and I can't find it.

>  ... sounds suspiciously like the TARDIS

>  I would buy food and stay in the time machine. Then I would stop myself from doing many mistakes

>  Would definitely just make my time machine look like The Tardis and travel between comic cons, nerdy events and stuff. Go about maybe to try and help people. I'd go to when the first person was classed or made a slave and try do something about it, with hopes it has an impact to today.

>  Uhm, where do I get such a TARDIS? 
Asking for a D... Friend

>  To The Time Machine

>  I wouldn't use the time machine. Instead I would use the matter replicator to summon infinite money

>  Basically if you have a tardis?
I’d hope there’s a civilisation that can give me a 2nd heart

>  Why would I need a time machine with a bed? Wait I get it for a place to sleep....

I go to middle school, tell them ignore the guy I wasted time on in high school, date this one, nix my then best friend, and become semi-normal, get a job, license, and finish college earlier with a good GPA.

>  try to add a kitchen in the time machine

>  Live Aid, I'll put the time machine in cloaking mode floating about ten metres from the floor. Chill and sit down in my bedroom and watch the concert.

>  Im gonna go back in time and steal the time machine from myself. And bend the laws of time and space

>  Can I just live in the time machine? I really don't want to go anywhere, just park it up in the middle of nowhere!

>  But you can only travel to the same date and time as you are currently in, or the earth won’t be there in space when you pop out of the 4th dimension. Or does the time machine travel the 800 kmps required to follow the earth’s rotation and orbit around the sun?

>  So, the TARDIS?

>  so basically the TARDIS....



[2]
>  Stay at home and use the matter replicator for drinks.

Sleep till its 3 pm.

>  I would go waaaaaay back to the dinosaurs. Cute lil guys. Pet em. Maybe even take one home.

>  I'd go home to pick up my wife and take her with me.

>  I want to go back to when I was old enough to run away from home.

>  i wouldn’t go anywhere, this is my home now

>  There’s a bed, a bath, and a matter replicator for me to make my own food. I’m going to stay in there and read Wikipedia curled up in a blanket. If I have Netflix, even better. (I know it’s a time machine but like...I could just stay home)

>  If it's got a matter replicator I'm sitting at home fucking with that until I get bored which is never.

>  Steins;Gate has taught me enough to know the time travel aspect is better left ignored. I'll just make it a really cool movable home.

>  Home.

>  im going home

>  I'm probably going to see my home town before it became a city in 1886

>  Home. My wife’s grandmother died when my wife was 1, and by all accounts she was a wonderful woman. I think my wife deserves to at least get to meet her.

>  Home.

>  I would go to my grandmother's home when she was a kid and ask about her family. I'd go as far back as I had to to really figure out my heritage. Its literally the only mystery to me that matters.

>  Home to make a sandwich before I start my adventure

>  Learn the true backstory of my parents
My mother was someone i can't talk about 
Taking to my mother its like talking to a slightly 
Nicer version of diavolo.
My dad rarely is home, i don't spend a lot of time with him...

>  Home.

>  Home. Cuz fuck life

>  Nowhere... I now have a home with free rent... Something I couldn't ever have in the real world

>  A day ago to stop Felix and Marzia's home being robbed and kill the bastards who did it.



[4]
>  Go into the past and get arrested in the years 1710, 1720, 1730, etc for selling “The elixir of immortality” (under my real name) until people think it’s real.

>  I'd subtly help cause wars across time using my superior knowledge to help push humanity to be miles ahead of where we are today in terms of technology. Then' I'd hit up the future and get my mind implanted into a cyborg body to live forever, and live through history, seeing everything there is to see. I'd leave texts that would be easily found in the future to fill our history books of what we're missing. What happened to Atlantis? Or all the natives that were killed, what was their culture like? What's in the Library of Alexandria. I'd slowly but surely start learning everything that's ever to be known, not staying in one place for too long.

>  I would go to the future, grab their wikipedia, then come back to now and become rich. Maybe with the help of a couple scientists

>  I go to the future and ask myself what I did in the past that worked out well for humanity.

>  The future!

>  10000 years in the future, then figure it out from there.  The past can be really interesting, but I’m stoked for Star Wars 57.

>  I'll just go travel past and meet my cat who's dead😭

>  Can it be used infinitely?

Does changing the past change the future or does it create another timeline?

>  To see how we ruined our future

>  I'd definitely unfuck my major fuck ups and push myself to all the cases I missed out on and lastly go to the future and be a rick

>  Tell my past self to spend more time with dad before it's too late

>  Go to the future. Come back. Win every lottery the next 5 years. Enjoy life.

>  If I went to the past, the future would change slightly, and that would mean that no one would be born, because other sperm would fertilize since there are millions of them. Then I would disappear and all my friends and family too

>  get every game ever made, travel to 100,000,00,000 years in the future, and just vibe in complete isolation.

>  1000 years into the future, to see what I can learn from there and bring back to help the rest of humanity advance faster.

>  Into the future to get all the lottery numbers for the next 100 years Sims style 😂

>  I would go into the future and predict and bet on big events. Or if they are dangerous like world wars, I would make sure i did something to stop it before it became a big thing

>  20 years into the future to see where I am in life

>  i would got to 42069 year

>  Honestly I’d go a little bit into the past to change it just enough to speed technology and general knowledge up. 

I wanna see what would happen if vaccines were available way sooner, or if pilgrims were able to build computers. 

I’d like to think it would make the “future” happen faster where there’s be flying cars and money isn’t needed anymore cause we can get anything we want whenever, and make anything disappear into matter whenever, but if I accidentally started an apocalypse no biggie I’d just spend my life in the time machine and try to un-fuck it all up.

>  I'd go to the future to see what it's like

>  Well not before electricity was invented because I wouldn’t have access to the internet which means there’s no going back to the future (no pun intended).

>  I'd go 40k years into the future to serve the Emperor.

>  I go one minute into the future, just to test it.

>  Here's how to become a god with time travel while actually resolving any paradoxes. Go to the future to buy a robot version of you that is almost exactly like real you, go to your birth, do a switch, and yeet real baby you off of a cliff or something. Then, you can just insert a preprogrammed key into a hidden port in your body you never noticed before, unlocking all of your robot intelligence and strength and basically making you immortal. After that, set up a button that sends your current consciousness back in time to a past version of robot you, giving you save points IRL. Also be sure to set up a backup version of you that updates every 5-10 seconds and automatically activates if the main you stops sending updates, letting you respawn.

>  Go 400 years into the future and learn about useful technology.

>  First things first. The future. To a time when death is defeated. To an age when there is a cure for everything. I get my hands on that cure then I go back in time to party like a rock star circa 1972. I'd go to antiquity second (after the future trip to become a superhuman). Probably ancient Greece (maybe 450BC). Party my balls off, knowing my pocket of future medicine has me covered in the event of an overdose or cardiac arrest. Not sure which party i'd time travel to next. Middle ages maybe. Wild West, at some point for sure. I'd probably go make a shit ton of money betting on historic games/stock market and then go live like a king somewhere. I'd basically be Rick Sanchez. (don't need his brain if you can time travel).

>  I feel like the obvious answer would be to go in future and grab the lottery numbers, but I instead would go to the past and star in some sort of famous  tv show (preferably a black and white detective film) that I know will make tons of money through wikipedia, I also can make the clothes of the time with the replicator, then profit off of that. I've always thought old detective films were awesome.

>  I go to Victorian era England with a machine gun and a ton of bullets. If anyone tries to come at me I just blow them up until I get to the king/prince who've is better looking. I demand a marriage proposal and at first they do it simply out of fear of the machine gun. But after awhile he falls in love with me. I, however, use him for political and social gain, getting the most expensive dresses, clothes, blankets made as well as having paintings made to depict their future but out past (9/11 Abe Lincoln being shot WWII all that good stuff). I will also have a ton of pictures of myself painted in clothes of various eras. After I am done confusing the people of the future I will become queen and have the rewritten so when my husband dies I will become the leader because I will have no children (he won't be able to kill me for it because I sill own the gun).

>  Open Wikipedia, click on random links until I find something that interest me. When I find an interesting article that I want to learn more that I'll visit the actual place, I time travel..... 

.....to before I open the Wikipedia. And alter the first link of the Wikipedia to direct my future self to a specific Wikipedia article that I know I'm gonna be interested to visit. Then I'll go there waiting my future self butt naked preparing to rape my future self ass.

Only to find my former self was already there prepared to rape me. I let him rape me, while I wait for my future self to arrive at this time so that both me and my former self can rape my future self. And watch this event unfold and repeat itself till eternity. 

This is gonna be a bamboozlement that I'll never forget. Shit gonna be cash.

>  I go to the future to play Half Life 3.

>  10 seconds ago so i can stop myself from destroying the entire word, because future past me would probably somehow do that.

>  4 years into the future

>  First I'm withdrawing all my money from my bank account into cash. Then i back in 2015, kill my past self, and invest all my money into a bitcoin.

>  I'm more interested in the future than the past. So I think I'd hop 150 years in the future, then another 50, and another until I figured out when we were really starting to explore the galaxy. I'd like to be there for that.

>  If I got a time machine, I'm pretty sure I'd never come back. So for starters, I'd use that matter replicator to generate some heckin' diamonds, find my friends and family, thank them for everything they've ever done, wish them the best (cry and give them bone crushing hugs), and hand them a diamond to set them up for the rest of their lives. I'll take the sick and the old to the future first and give them another 10-20 years with the new medicine that's bound to be there. Then I'd say my final goodbyes and head straight to when Hitler committed suicide just so I can watch. After that, to the future.

>  I go-to the future and play the new video games.

>  Post capitalism future

>  I'd start with going to the future to see how technology comes along. I might be able to get a new type of SRS or gender affirming treatment beyond my dreams. Then I'd go to the past, ~1980s, to see all the things I missed before I was born. Retro Nintendo, blockbuster in it's prime (maybe even visit the local one before it became the last blockbuster), old IBM computers, arcades.  I think I might want to visit one of my ancestors who won 3 Oscars and was influential in Hollywood, interview him. He has a Wikipedia page himself, so he'd be amazing to talk to! After a while, if leaving Earth wasn't an option I'd probably special:random and go where it takes me. I'd probably try to make my lifespan as long as possible using technology of the future and settle down somewhere where I can get a private spot of land, maybe with a spouse, and live a quiet life for a while, not having to work and getting to live a life of leisure. Beyond material needs I would be able to educate myself on all aspects of the past and the future, or may find it pointless and simply opt to do live somewhere rainy. I find sitting in the rain to be the most relaxing thing for me, I could go around to every single rainstorm ever. I would be able to live without stress and be content with my life.

>  So we get the TARDIS? Cool. I suppose I’d go to the time and place of my birth, greet my parents and tell them they’ll know me soon. I’d continue to travel and befriend my younger self. Younger me from that timeline would think back on those times when he gets older and realizes he is beginning to look like that strange person he keeps seeing. Then I’d leave to go explore the far future, then return to the present day with a colossal knowledge of what will happen in the future.

>  Wherever I am 10 years in the future to ask what went wrong.

>  Will go to future to learn the cure for Cancer,Aids.

>  Definitely do that thing Biff did in Back to the Future 2 where he buys a sports history book and bets on all the games

>  First thing I would do is stop my brothers conception (he is evil) to test what would happen to me. After this one of two things would happen I would disappear and become stuck in a paradox or create an alternate timeline in which he was never born but I continue to exist as a ruminant of the original timeline. If I be come a ruminant then I will go on to have secret meetings with my past self to give him advice on what to do in order to prevent anything embarrassing.


Also I would give myself hella cash

>  One or two days into the future to see who won games, races, contracts etc., so I can dip back to the present and clean house!

>  So basically, completely safe time travel? I can go anywhere and not have to worry about any harm coming to me? Well, since my view of time travel is that no matter what I do in the past, the future doesn't change because there's only one past and my actions are already in it, then... time for an all-expenses-paid gourmet world tour through space and time. Dodo, ground sloth, weird carboniferous vegetables... we eating good tonight bois!!!

>  I'd set up a controlled experiment where I see if its absolute time travel where grandpa paradox's crash reality, or multiverse time travel, where alterations don't have consequences.  Pretty important that.

Then into the future, while wearing a hazmat suit, because future diseases would ruin my un-evolved biome.

If I travel to the past, wear a mazmat suit so that my advanced evolved bacteria/viruses don't reek absolute havoc on everything.

Pretty much you can't do anything in the future or past, because your biology is meant for **THIS TIME ALONE**.

>  To the future to increase my lifespan, then to the past to have fun :).

>  Travel into the future when they inevitable solve aging and death. Become immortal. Everything can come after that, I'd have all the time in the world.

>  I would first go like 1000 years into the future, and try to save the wikipedia from that time, hoping that it would give me insight into my future, and not just my past like present day wikipedia would.

>  Go to maybe 100 years in the future and download the updated and current(future) wikipedia database and return back to my original timeline. That way I could make investments and small bets and lotteries in my own timeline without having to give up current luxuries or adapt to future societies.

>  Honestly start by going back to a place in time where you know a bunch of treasure is discovered in the future based on wikipedia's knowledge,  get the treasure,  sell the treasure. Then go to there start of every decade and invest in companies that you know are gonna hit it big soon.  As you go to the next decade you sell stock and reinvest in the next big thing.  Eventually you make so much money you're a trillionaire.  Then you go into the future after leaving your money invested in a 1% interest savings account.  The future you stop at is a space-fi where corporations rule everything and you own the largest most powerful corporation over an entire galaxy and thousands of planets.  You use your fortune to stay alive forever and ever using genetic clones and conscious transplants.

>  I would never go to the past to solve or resolve anything cause it's because of the past we are where we are but I would totally go to the future and visit all my descendents and just explore with no goal in mind.

>  Dinosaurs
Then to as far as I can go into the future
And then back to Dinosaurs so I can replicate what I saw and destroy the universe as a whole

>  Well, I'd go to the future and see what badass stuff they bring up. Then, I go to 2017, get a Ford GT, then go back to the medieval ages to show people what the future holds. Why? Idk, probably outta boredom.

>  One thousand years into the future. I can study the past, and visiting it is definitely on the agenda, but the future first.

>  2000 years in the future to see how humanity turned out.

>  I would would go to the future first than come back and use my new knowledge to make a new better  world.

>  Win the lottery in the future and bring the $2.5 trillion back to present day. I haven't thought much beyond that.

>  Going to a future that is ruled by giraffe.

>  .. So you're saying that I can go back and forth between timelines, obtain knowledge on ways to potentially stay immortal, and fuck around with everyone by using the Matter Replicator to make legit aliens of my design?

Not to mention I could bring whoever I want with me??

Imagine even making a very discreet secret paying service where you can let someone see into the past or the future of some point if they paid enough. Archeological studies will boom, our current scientific knowledge will skyrocket, which will make more knowledge for the future that's available to the present.. Hence repeat? 

This is so exploitable I'm laughing in "German mad scientist".

>  As far as where I would go first would be dependent on one thing, if I was suspended in time myself in that I don’t age I would record every major event in history, video, audio, whole nine yards, I would unlock our past in a way we could never imagine now. If I was not essentially immortal I would likely do something similar but significantly more selective, as opposed to the *entire* Hundred Years’ War only the key parts. My life would be dedicated to recording the past for all to see.

>  Assuming there is still a society around, far into the future.  I'll use the matter replicator to create whatever resource is in demand, trade it for goods and live a life that would seem like that of a God to me.

>  I would go and fix all my dumb past mistakes that made me a fatass

>  Go to the future, look at their Battle Droids, go back, use matter replicator to build a Billionnof the fuckers and make me the Emperor of all Humankind

>  into the future !! that'd be so awesome !! ***i want to know what else is out there...***

>  I would go to the past, kill past me, and start a paradox loop.

>  Definitely 10 years into the future to see where I end up. Adulting seems scary and I wanna make sure I’m not a loser

>  To the future in 5 year, then 10 year, increasing increments, and consuming the latest and greatest hentai as it comes out. also games and stuff i guess. i think things are going to be more difficult after about 40 years because being from the past it will be harder to assimilate even temporarily, whereas in the other direction you have the time advantage and nothing you have no experience with is gonna surprise you.

>  To the future?

>  Future to get updated copy of Wikipedia and replicate whatever medical device or drugs used to live forever. Then I go check out Jesus to make sure he's legit. Then I go to the past after the recovery of the most recent mass extinction event and live in a castle in the mountains. I preach about the importance of preserving the environment and only teach the people about sustainable things.

>  I'd probably just go to the future and play video games that aren't out but will come out. Like I want to play the witcher 5 or danganronpa 52 or something like that. I can even look at wikipedia and see the aggregate reviews of a bunch of games and find games that are so good that I can't miss. The same thing also applies to music.

>  go to the future see some events and products. take a really practical ptoduct then come back claim im from the future predict events for money and sell the product

>  Go into the future lets say 2050 by a sports book of ever sports game since 2000... And maybe take a sneak peak at the memes

>  Go to the future and check how the world looks after every 50- 100 years. get myself a new body if that becomes a thing, and hopefully life for ever traveling through time.

obviously got to the poast at some point and become crazy rich so i can afford all that, if it's possible and we do not fuck up.

&#x200B;

If we fuck up in the next foreseeable future i would make a youtube channel predicting everything and post memes a week before they exist.

>  I wonder if there was a list of all the individuals who committed suicide. Since I've essentially got infinite time, I would leave a flower in every one of the individual's rooms with a positive note in their respective language. Then I would then chose to do whatever I want to ensure that I get the Time machine. If I have more time then I would slowly trickle info from the future to the past in a manner that doesn't destroy the world.

>  Look for an immortality drug in the future.

>  Go to the future buy all new inventions from the future  come back and start selling them.

>  The year 69, then 420

>  Make 60 second rice, go to the future in a minute so it's instant rice

>  The ISS. Or the future ISS. Anywhere in space really.

>  Bruh I'm skipping 6 years into the future where I've successfully finished my degree, immigration and I'm living with my gf

>  Well first I would use rhe matter re po replicator to expand the time machine then go to the future and get extremely compressed data storage and download the entire internet as well as the medical technology... I would then proceed to the dawn of humanity and become either a god or a demon!

>  I would go in the future version of any game shop, and steal some unreleased games to sell them in the present.

>  First?

First I start experimenting, with short hops in time.  Find out through small and safe experimentation the answer to various questions:

* is it possible to coexist in time

* is it possible to change the past

* is it possible to change the past in a paradoxical way

* if I have sex with my past self, is it gay or just very advanced masturbation

* is it possible to create information ex nihilo (bootstrap paradox)

Only when I have that information do I plan my travel, so I can know how careful I need to be.

>  I would routinely travel into the future to download more databases to make my collection complete, and then go check out a bunch of stuff as long as I won't end up altering any events.

>  Go to the caves where early man lived, then write stuff that’s vague enough not to confuse the people but would be enough for people thousands of years in the future to say “they predicted the future!” and then move on with their lives.

>  First I’mma go hang out with my Mum for a long time.  Actually, can we change the present or is it fixed? If I change things I’d tell the hospital to start treating her chest infection two days earlier than they did.  Or fuck it, I’ll go into the future and get the cure for Leukaemia and bring it back.

>  Straight to the future. I want to learn what comes next.

>  I would go in the future to see what wille happen next

>  First I keep incrementally going into the future until I find such a time as cancer is cured and healthcare is free and easily accessible, then I go back to 2011ish and get my dad and bring him to that future

>  In the future 3800+  AD

>  Well I'll recruit some scientists to make a top secret DNA altering formula to make me a time lord. Then I simply go to the future when it's done. Use it and have fun traveling through space and time.

>  Damn imma just tell my past self some good life advice

>  Decide on a time and place to be 50 or so years in the future, travel there and have a future version of myself tell me all the things I should and not be doing with a time machine. Assuming I'm not dead at least.

>  50 years into the future, 100 years into the future, 200 years into the future, 400 years into the future, until I reach earth's extinction, then come back and explore the past.

>  I'd go 50 years in the future, maybe ASOIF will be completed by then?

>  the future

>  Five-ten years into the future. I'd replicate some then-ubiquitous piece of technology, and bring it back with me. Then I'd sell the technology needed to make it.

Alternatively, I'd travel back to the early 2010s, when I was still at university, and buy 100,000 bitcoin. Then I'd travel to the present and "rediscover" my old hard drive with the keys, and sell them all. I'd be taxed out the eyeballs and I'd lose money due to not selling them earlier, but I'd avoid the tax issues associated with not declaring assets if I sold them at their peak - mustn't do anything that can mess up my present situation. Then, I'd live the life of the idle rich. Same investment plan as if I had a lottery win.

>  I'd go into the future and arrive at special moments in my life to see what my life is like and learn as much as possible about my future. Then I'd intervene with my future self's life. So times when future me is shy, me in a disguise will pull them away and step in as future me and not be shy. Also try to make my past self talk to my girlfriend more so I'm not so shy around her.

>  I would travel back to one of the moments when I was on the verge of suicide and convince myself to do it. To do so it would be already sufficient to just tell myself how things in future will be.

>  Honestly I'd take a good eternity to just.. find myself. I would experience all of the past, fully. Understand it. Then I'd come back to today and live the rest of my life without knowing the future

>  Invest in the stocks that are huge today back when they just began, like Apple for example. Then I’d go to the future, see what stocks have done the same and incest in those in the present day.

>  I would attend a lot of concerts from the past.  I am not sure which would be first.  Definitely would spend a lot of time in the 1990 s.

>  Travel to the future, discover immortality and learn literally everything that has ever happened

>  As someone super interested in history and all that, the future, I'll hop forward a hundred years at a time and check society for the next few centuries, if something goes wrong I'll find some history books, check the local internet, find someone to explain. Them take all that I learned to avoid catastrophic futures, and guide humanity, plus I got a time machine so when I come back people will believe me. Fucking with the past is a surefire way to create paradoxes, fuck the world up, get killed. Plus imagine going a couple hundred years forward and being able to spoil real life for someone...

>  First I'd go to the future and check if there will be any world war, or tyrany taking over the world soon, and then I'd go like 15/20 years back, and recreate Steins;Gate scenario or somethin'.

>  First, to the future, where I get the cure for aging then into the past where I try to advance civilization by bringing modern day inventions.

>  I'd probably prevent WW2, just to see how long the Great Depression would last if we hadn't gone into war, by using the power of Wikipedia. I'd use the matter replicator to make a sort of e-book that'll make reading the Wikipedia easier such as being able to search for specific things like dates and people because actively searching for some stuff just might be too long. I would then use that book to be a sort of Prophet and come to key people in the past and tell them about whatever decision they would choose and have them think it over. Just to see what kind of person they are. Would the people that assassinated Franz Ferdinand not Kill him knowing what would come in the War? Would the guy that rejected Hitler from Art School reject him knowing what would become? I'd then go into the future and see what type of impact their decisions would have made by going into their schools and looking into the worlds history lessons. 




That and I would like to see what it is like to go to have a fling with ladies of the past and future, both commoners, rich, and the well known (basically the ones we see in history books, is what I'm trying to say).

>  Now thats the life i wanna be living! First I'd look up in wiki if I'm immortal inside the time machine due to relativity or if i just age normally. If i age i would probably travel to the future to see how it is and if i like it stay there. If i happen to be immortal i would start a journey visiting historical events over humanities timeline. Find out where we came from how we discovered tools when we got intelligent. Then proof or disproof if jesus was really born and after that go to other various events in more modern world like world wars and key events in them elections technological breakthroughs etc and again then go to the future

>  The future of course. I will kote down all major sport events, who wins etc., what companies flourish and so on.
After that I go back in time, invest my money and look my account on ice. I go into the future again, but this time every few years foreword to touch upon my account, so that the money doesn't get seized by the government.

>  To the year i was born in to tell my parents a little something. Then I'd go to the far future and live in peace

>  Go steal manga from the future and read everything to spoil it for thise manga cunts who spoil it for me (btw in a hybrid) I read and watch anime/manga

>  Check my future self and be thoroughly disappointed...

>  get a huge stockpile of modern medicine. nothing too advanced, just antibiotics etc that dissolve in water. the dissolve in water part is important. i’m also gonna need some priestly/holy looking clothes. head to the middle ages, preferably when simony wasn’t a sin because i’m gonna be bringing the cash in. i’ll land my time machine outside outside a church on sunday so they think i’m a saint rather than a witch. then i’ll say god sent me to heal them for a small price, and dissolve the drugs in water and say i just blessed it. i won’t take money as payment, because it’ll be worthless when i get home, i’ll make sure to only take gold and things of historical importance i can flog to museums. 

if this isn’t enough, i might do a little more to raise cash. just looking up where the biggest diamond and gold mines are on wikipedia and when they were found and finding them first. go to the gold rush but know where all the gold actually is. invent amazon just before it’s meant to get invented with me as the leader, and then fake my own death when i got bored (and yes. i would be nice to my employees) 

i wouldn’t kill baby hitler, because killing babies is fucked up and i’d look like an asshat. i’d assassinate adult hitler, knowing exactly where previous assassins failed from wikipedia, and then i’d be a hero and i wouldn’t have to live with killing a baby. 

once i have enough, i’m going to the future, not the present (assuming this time machine also goes into the future). i will have already stealthily checked the future out with my cloaking device, to make sure it’s not too dystopian and just has cool with like cybernetics and flying cars and looks like a cyberpunk 2077 screenshot. this poses no advantage for me, i just really like cyberpunk settings and i want to live in one. plus now that i’m filthy rich 1.) if the government is super corrupt i’ll be fine because i’ll be rich and can bribe them into not caring who i am, why i don’t know what year it is, and why i have so much gold. plus there’s more cool shit to buy in the future, like flying cars and prosthetics that make so you can shoot lasers out of your arms. i’ll sell all of the gold and shit, and i can always go back for more if i want or if the future starts sucking/turns out not to be super capitalist like my plan kind of banks on it being

then i relax in my neon skyscraper with my cybernetically enhanced future husband, who i love very much, and have the life of my dreams

...I think about this a lot

>  Probably go back and forth in time and etch my name in past and future history as a Time traveller. Probably people will think I am God. 
Also save lot of lives in the mean process. With great power comes great responsibility.

>  To the future, precisely 2050 to see if we all aint dead yet from global warming.

>  100 years into the future to see if we made it... And if we did, how high the sea level is now.

>  Go to the future where the Emperor of Mars Elon the III has made genetically engineered cat girls.

>  I go to the future to find out who killed epstein.

>  First I post this exact question on reddit to get good ideas... then I just go into the future anyway to see what happens... then I make an educated decision about what to do based on what the current future holds... 
travel, observe, collect data, masturbate.

>  I wouldn't want to go into rhe past because I think that would break space-time so better not risk it.
But I would go into the future and see how funny the human race dies out.

>  Future. I'd like to visit my country on year 3019.

>  So if I travel to my own future, would present me merge with future me and gain all the memories from the time in between? Or will there be two of me running around?

>  I would travel into the Future and all the developments they have would I Take back to my time, and this will i do some hundred Times...

>  I would, go to my past self when I had $100 for example and matter replicate the fuck out of the money

>  I would go 1000 years into the future. I'd be interested to know if:
a) we advance super technologically and figure out interstellar travel;
b) regress to a caveman state; or
c) have gone extinct

>  Go forward and look for winning lottery numbers, predict crazy future events, and post it all on 4chan. Also solve all the unsolved mysteries, like Roswell.

>  How does time travel work? Is it like back to the future or is it like endgame?

>  The future to check out how I’m doing. I’d do 20 years out so I could see a decent chunk. If the ‘laws’ of time travel don’t exist that is. Im pretending everything is not set in stone once I see it and I can change things to make progress!

>  The future. Cat girls I'm coming.

>  To the future to see if global warming is legit

>  The past, throwing paper airplanes at my past self with life advice. Either that or taking the bullet for one of the most "Open-Headed" presidents.
