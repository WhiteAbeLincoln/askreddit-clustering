The light blinks on it, which is annoying, so they have to change their change  batteries. Then when they do. The remote doesn't work for that TV and they either have to reprogram it, which most people don't have the remote directions to reprogram it, now they have to call Customer Service for a fucking cable company, no matter what company they're always a fucking pain. 
Most remotes you have to hold the setup button to program it with a code for your tv. Which i also would have scraped the brand off of it and changed the input to an output they don't use.

Sure they're easily replaceable, but then you have go to Walmart or wherever, find the right cable for your phone, decide whether or not you should get a "fancier" one, and how long should the cable be? "How long was my old one? With a longer cable, I can peruse Reddit in bed which I couldn't really do while charging before because the outlet was too far away. Maybe I should just get a cheap one because I want to upgrade my phone soon but then I have to save up $800 for the phone I want and that's going to take awhile so I might as well just buy a better one that's going to last, but then buying a nicer cable would be more expensive and just further postpone buying the new phone and now I have to wait in line..."

>  *True Story Alert*

When I was in my freshman year of college, a fraternity I would kick it at threw a party. There was an associate member called Hee-haw Wheesnaw McGraw, or some onomastic partition or aggregation with various rhyming lines.

During the party, we went by his room. Now, Hee-Haw's room was notoriously messy with everything thrown around like those artists who splatter paint around the 3 dimensions of the quadrilatiral room that is their canvas; Wheesnaw's canvas was like that similie but with food and beer cans and blankets and Lord knows what else. So, needless to say we were surprised when entering his room and finding the place not in its normal disarray but in a sort of disarrayed abnormal upturn. 
His room had been entered and slightly trashed. Wheesnaw was steaming mad, talking fastly about the enchaosed chaos that had ended his lathargic ordered room's security, ane thus is before our later discovery. But, that stupor turned to disgusted anger when he discovered a used condum on the floor near his bed; somewhat decided to break into Hee-Haw's room for some dirty pleasure. 
As See-Saw McGraw struggled to keep his composure, we attempted to provide some succor by drawing his attention to theft or burglary.

"Was anything taken?", we asked. "I. I don't know.... Someone fucked in my bed... Where I sleep" came the reply. "Keep it together; was anything stolen? Look around" was our friendly directive. "Uhm. Uhm." He muttered as he shifted his room's contents and took quick stock of whatever sentimental possessions lay scattered, whether by his hand or some horny burglars'. 

All of a sudden, McGraw rushes to his desk. "My computer is still here!" he exclaimed with relief. He picks up his latop with sentiment, and begins turning it over for damage. "Dammit" came the quick reply as he rapdily sets down his laptop and starts searching the desk. "No. No! NO!" he ejaculated. "What?!" was all the rest of us could muster watching this poor, abused guy frantically search under his desk. "They must have taken it" moaned an anguished Whessnaw. "Taken what?", we demanded.

His reply came with a furious scream. "They took my usb plugin for my wireless mouse!" Of course, the realization was only begining to impress itself upon us. "Is it in the mouse?" someone asked. Whessnaw grasped his mouse, flipped it in his left, sweaty and red hand, removing the tiny black trapdoor that conceals such usb adapters. "NO!" He cried aloud. "No. It's gone. They took it! He quickly bellowed in sorrowful recongition of the burglary. 
"Then, why is the mouse here?" Someone else inquired. Well, that question deployed pur mutual recognition of a great burglary beyond any malevolence of Smaug or cunning of Bilbo Baggins. Someone broke into Wheesnaw's room, trashed it and had sex on his bed (although we never did figure the order or simultaneity of the events) and then stole his mouse's usb wireless receiver while leaving the mouse. 

For Wheesnaw, it was like having a bricked phone. During the week when one of the brothers began LAN gaming with other brothers, Wheesnaw became infuriated at his inability to participate not do to ownership of the games, but his purloined usb adapter. That burglar may have taken his most prized possession: the ability to not use his laptop's mousepad like a disoriented seamstress with a high-powered sewing machine. 

You may be wondering how this story ends. Does Wheesnaw catch the burglar(s) and deploy a can of McGraw patented whoop-ass? Perhaps one big misunderstanding is discovered, and his room was just disoriented and he found an old condum? Maybe it was Mr. Plum in the Library with a pipe? 

None of these endings comes to pass. Instead, Wheesnaw turned bright red with tremors of fantastic frenzy and dysphoria; his eyes widening with a vexed girth. He had no choice except accepting his burglary, which was now his bedeviling. Spontaneously, Hee-Haw stormed out out of his room to the bar, snatched someone's fifth of Jagermeister (of course, no other alchohol was in swiping territory) and sucked 6 - 8 shots down. The room rejoiced. Wheesnaw then lit a cigarette, slouched in a chair, and tried tonremain conscious as a silly grin swept over his countenance and replaced his chagrin. 
 
Some houes later, he washed his sheets, cleaned his room for the first and last time ever, and ordered a new adapter, which took days to arrive, causing him to miss out on LAN parties while scouring the house for the old adapter.

>  Replace thier pillows to identical pillows that are always warm on both sides and take thier curtains they're always gonna hate bedtime

>  The bobbing thing in toilets so the water just keeps rising.

>  I was recently burgled and they stole all my electronics, however the most smoothing thing was on thanksgiving day when I was getting ready I realized they stole my fucking belt so my pants kept falling down

>  I would just move everything around  slightly. So the doors hit into thing when opened, the tv is off centre. Change the light bulbs to rapid flashing disco bulbs. You know little things that they might not notice straight away.

>  I would steal all there dogs/cats or any animal then the carpet

>  Nothing, I would just rearrange their keys.

>  I wouldnt steal anything. I would take all my dead batteries and swap them out for the good ones. Leave them the dead ones.


Either that or break in and leave a small weird item. It would leave them constantly wondering. Therefore taking there piece of mind

>  Switch all sugar with salt and all salt with sugar. That banana bread is about to get real salty

>  The doorknobs

>  Those lil plastic things on the ends of shoelaces

>  The rod their clothes hang on in the closet...

>  The milk, but only if I see they also have cereal

>  Take the cheese slicer and grater as well as the ice cream scoop and theor favorite spatula. They'll be looking for them for hours thinling "I know I had it" and they'll clean their entire house to find them to no avail.

>  I think the best answers to this would be any small part that makes a bigger thing/task pointless and is hard to come across that item by singularly buying it. With that being said, I would steal car keys

>  Just their socks Cuz winter is coming

>  Old family photos, irreplaceable but hold no value to anyone else.

>  Steal their baguettes, I don’t know I just like baguettes

>  Take all the small Tupperwares and all the lids for the large Tupperwares. You would never have a match. Ever.

>  Probably a hair brush.

>  Their right foot. Silly dudes will be walking in circles forever!

>  All the spatulas... anyone else here crack an egg in a frying pan and then realize all the spatulas are dirty and then frantically rush to clean one...

>  Not to sidetrack the conversation, but always used to tip pictures on the wall, just enough to notice, all over the house as a passive aggressive move toward my now ex-wife. She’s anal retentive but never ever asked anyone. Just enough to notice, like someone brushed against it.   For years she went around the house straightening pictures


OR

The toilet paper holder stand. “It LOOKS best closer here”; “But that’s where my knee hits when I sit down” so I’d move it back. We played THAT for 10 years.

>  Underwear

>  I mean this is more than a slight inconvenience but I would steal there pug sockets . Completely useless to me but I think it would be extremely annoying

>  I heard this from a different thread that had to deal with lawsuit. Since the defendant couldn't pay for things despite being really rich and his house was too much they started taking smaller items that would be super inconvenient like the half-read book on the guys nightstand and the garage door opener.

>  Hmm, stealing the right thing might be difficult. I would say, Remote control to their TV, but those are replaceable.

I'd instead move around their car keys and probably just take that one thing they've been fantasizing about eating in their fridge while they're out.

>  IDE steal utensils, but not obvious ones, ones like a spatula or a can opener.

>  I once had someone break into my Nissan that had pay stubs and my girl (at the times) purse. They only took my aux cord. Not only was I pissed but I couldn't listen to music I wanted which pissed me off more for the whole ride home

>  Nothing, I’d only switch which way the toilet paper faced

>  The caps to all their tubed goods, like toothpaste, neosporin, ect...

Might as well cut their plastic wrap and foil rolls in half too so they have to use up twice as much to do the same job.

>  I would steal their phone charger to start a riot between their family.

>  I steal that little twist-tie thing for thier loafs of bread

>  Every single cord. Charger, power cords, anything I can think of that I use

>  Definitely stealing all of their batteries out of TV remotes, game controllers etc. so annoying to sit down before realizing your remote is dead

>  Their colander. They decide it’s pasta night, have fun pouring out the water from the pot into the sink!

>  Their lamp shades

>  My Jeep Wrangler was broken into once. Sliced open my soft top side panel with a blade instead of just unzipping it. What did they steal? My favourite air freshener.   8 years later and I’m still mad AF about it.

>   Bed pillows

>  Toilet paper. They're on the toilet and there's no toilet paper. They sit on the toilet waiting for someone else in the house to get back from the store with some toilet paper. The next time it happens, they're home alone. They grap whatever's closest: a towel. They use it and it gets stained, so they need to throw it out. Gradually over time, they use up all their towels. Once out of towels, they start using tissues and bars of soap. Of course they need to replace these items all the time, and slowly and slowly they start losing money. One day, they go bankrup. The bank takes their house, their car, and all their possessions. They start working second jobs just to have enough money for food. They're living on the streets, sometimes staying over at people's houses. They're so broke they run out of money for blankets, and when winter comes, they start freezing. The wife dies, and now her husband is left alone with nobody. Luckily, his wife had life insurance. He has enough money to rent an appartment. One day he's at the store and he spots the lottery tickets. He decides to buy one, figuring it'll be fun to try. But just his luck, he won. He won a million dollars. He couldn't believe it. He goes to the store and buys all the toilet paper he can get. Little does he know, I'm just around the corner. While he's asleep I raid his stash of toilet paper, and it's all gone by morning. A million dollars worth of toilet paper, gone, just like that. He had nothing again, stuck working two jobs at minimum wage just to pay the bills. He goes and buys a single roll of toilet paper. He puts it in the middle of his living room and goes to sleep. In the middle of the night, he wakes up to the sound of me climbing through his window, and as I'm about to grab the roll, he lunges for it and saves it from my grasp. He gets up and stares me directly in the eyes. This is it. This is the final stand off. With me out of the way, he'll stop losing all of his toilet paper, and he'll finally get his life back in order. He grabs the things closest to him: a bottle. He takes a step towards me. defenceless, I duck as he throws his bottle at my head. It hits the wall and it shatters. He takes another step and I back up. He starts running towards me and tackles me like a bull. He lands a hit right in my nose. I kick him in the leg and push him off me. I run to the other end of the room. My head is pouding, I can feel the blood gushing out of my nose. But the adrenaline is pumping, and I'm ready to win this fight. He gets up slowly, and my right hand feels behing me for something to him him with. I feel a ceramic vase, and my fingers wrap around it and I pull it towards me. He's standing now, staring at me with a look I've never seen before. Once again he runs at me, but this time I'm prepared. Clutching the vase, I lift it in the air and smash it over his head. He falls, only this time he doesn't get up. He's knocked out, so I grab my belt and unwrap it from my waist. I hold up his head and wrap the belt around his neck. I start strangling him, and I don't let go for ten minutes. I feel for a pulse. He doesn't have one. I've won. "All this for a roll of toilet paper?" I think to myself. But I know it was worth it. I grab the roll and leave, looking for another victime to slea from.

>  Tupperware lids

His good ties

One shoe lace

Spare keys

Minutes hands from all analog clocks.

>  Doorknobs

>  I'll take their can opener because it's something that isn't really noticed until it's needed. So when they need to open a can, they wont be able to find one and they'll have to open the can like the savages they are

>  10mm socket

>  Every 10mm socket and wrench.

>  All the fucking double A batteries

>  All toilet paper, soap, shampoo, underwear, the router/modem.

>  A 10mm socket

>  Every year or so I get angry enough about the lid situation to go through the entire container cupboard and match them all and throw away the ones that don't go to anything.

2 weeks later I'm swearing at the damn containers again. It's ridiculous. I think someone is sneaking in and stealing lids.

>  I go to the fridge and steal one thing every day. This will cause the family to get mad at each other because of who stole their pudding. I will continue to do this until the family is broken up.

>  The printer ink... That shit would drive me insane

>  All knobs to the stove. Sure it still works...but isnt that just so ugly? That or all the pot holders

>  1: take the toilet paper, make it wet. Just every roll in the house. Leave them whole so that the person then will go to get paper, it falls appart. Go for a spare roll? Too bad. Crab walk for the multipack you got 2 days back on sale? Whoops!

2: hairties. Make sure they dont have any on them, then just take them all assuming they have long hair. Long hair is annoying. 

3: remove toothpaste from tubes, refill with anything else. 

4: take all bin liners and bags. They will see the bin is overflowing, go to remove it and get a bag, and have none. Now they have to go buy more. 

5: bend the cutlery. 

6: take half the screws out of hinges. Also if you can make them squeak. 

7: take any opaque bottles, empty them, fill with water or the wrong products. Body wash is now conditioner, shampoo is in the conditioner bottle and the shampoo bottle is water. 

8: dull any knives in the house. 

9: water down the soap a lot. 

10: change the settings on their heating if you can. Make it that bit too hot/cold. 

Just a few ideas off the top of my head.

>  Take all the charging cables, and replace them with ones that work only half of the time, or ones for brands they don't use.

>  there Dog that they neglect

>  Dog/cat/animal food/water bowls; cut toothbrushes in half (like, length wise) and take the other half; remove handles from all cabinets and drawers, maybe even the fridge; cut the power cord for the dryer, so that way they end up using the washer and can't use the dryer; dig holes into the yard so they fall into them randomly, and eventually having to take random paths in the yard, to avoid the holes, only to find more; put a lock on everything possible; the cold handle for the sink(s); 3 tiles from the shower walls, in no pattern; and lastly I'd replace their tires with slightly smaller tires and pop one of the new ones so they have to go get a replacement and when they return with it they'll fix the flat just to find their vehicle sitting lopsided, since the new tire they just bought, will be larger than the other three. Thank you 💕

>  I would steel their entire stash of toilet paper. The moment they realize they're out, they'll probably need it more than ever, if you know what I'm sayin'

>  All the screws and bolts loose enough and easy enough to get at to remove with just a Phillips head and mid-sized wrench.

>  taking one sock from each person in the family, mismatching the pair

>  What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany’s at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It’s priceless. As I’m taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It’s her father’s business. She’s Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don’t trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he’s the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She’s been waiting for me all these years. She’s never taken another lover. I don’t care. I don’t show up. I go to Berlin. That’s where I stashed the chandelier.

>  Don't steal things. Move things. They will all think that they are going insane.

>  I SHALL STEAL EVERYONES BATTERIES

>  I wouldn’t take anything; I’d just super glue stuff to the ground/table
ie remote, chair, baked beans, cat, etc.
If you really want to be evil with it, tilt paintings/pictures slightly to the side and super glue them like that

>  an inch from one of the stairs in the middle of the wooden staircase

>  Small shit like a cube of ice a pen and or maker I know they need the next day

>  I'd steal all their milk and eggs

>  I am... the sex toy thief. 

Be it dildo or fleshlight, 

You will not get relief,

And if you buy more, then I will be back another night.

>  Their leftovers.

>  All the soap.

>  The doorknob on the inside of the house door. 

So many wtf’s and the initial problem with actually closing the door.  Would be hilarious to watch.

>  Go to a workplace and steal all of the pens except for the one that's the same color as the paper

>  I am stealing that lamp. THAT LAMP!

>  Not steal but just take the SD/microSD cards out of everything and hide them around the house. Just spent multiple months looking for a microSD I lost and it was under my bed. tore apart my entire room for it too.

>  On a serious note, this is what the Stasi did to dissidents and political rights activists (I am sure other Communist countries did similar things). 

They would enter someone's home, and then slightly rearrange stuff in the kitchen, or steal the coffee filters, etc. It was a routine element of a number of measures to mentally stabilise these dissidents. Either they were believing they were slowly going mad, because they mislaid all those things. Or they would somehow suspect that someone was in their house, but would not know when, or who, or what else they did while they were there.

It's basically a form of psychological torture.

>  Take the whole house

>  The batteries in all your remotes.

Cept I don't even steal em.

I just put em in backwards.

And then put the remotes in different rooms.

>  Every 10mm socket I come across

>  Their leftover food

>  I don't know which one of you fucks it was, I need my fucking will to live back

>  Their fitted sheets

>  This question.

>  I steal all their toilet and shower mats so they now have to put towels on the floor until they can but some more.

>  Hand towels

>  Wheres jane when you need her?

>  Cannopener or TP for bungholes

>  This question

>  The table with the most stuff.
Just the table, everything else is going on the floor

>  Well, looks like you're out of milk again. I could swear there was a whole bottle left.

>  Oxygen, who needs it anyway?

>  Astma inhalers

>  Random individual socks


Or the batteries out of every remote

>  The tab you pull to zip and unzip zippers.

>  Toothpaste, no one wants to go to the store with bad breath to get more toothpaste. They will probably run into someone they know and have a rumor started about how they have bad breath and made up some unbelievable story about their toothpaste being stolen.

>  The material where the big toe goes in all of their socks.

>  All of the toilet paper in the house, they know they just bought some so when they go to take a shit, the sheer terror in their eyes will be priceless

>  Their lucky underwear.

>  Shoelaces. Imagine trying to go to work or gym and not being able to use your shoes properly.

>  Deodorant to make the trip really awkward

>  Brush.

>  One Dollar. From anyone that passes me. *In New York.*

>  Toothbrush, every morning it is fucking gone.

>  I was burgled once and among other things they took all apart from 1 of the duvet covers and also my shampoo and conditioner. That was really bloody irritating. So that.

>  Dish soap

>  10 mm sockets.

>  I don't know if some said it already but.... Toliet papers.

>  The fridge light bulb, the paper towel holder, and (if they have one) what they use to indicate if the dishwasher is full of clean or dirty dishes.

>  Their wallet. So many small inconveniences in one item, plus I get their money.

>  Batteries. Now when they need batteries they need to go to the store

>  Toiletpaper

>  Their most comfortable underwear.

>  I would take one of those measuring cups that come in specific measurements

when they need that specific one they'll realise

>  One of the 2 phone charges,  preferably the one in the bedroom.  Now they have to remember to charge their phone during the day so the battery lasts until morning when their alarm goes off.  Inevitably they'll forget at some point and have to unplug their charger from the outlet just out of reach behind the couch and plug it in an outlet in the bedroom.   Now the one by the nightstand again is out of reach because the top outlet already has the electronic tooth brush plugged in so they can't see the bottom outlet.   On the other hand they can use the outlet across the room but now they have to get out of bed to hit the snooze button so they might as well just wake up.

>  Your social security card. 

But not to steal your identity..

Just so you can freak out and constantly check your credit and background like a crackhead hoping to not see something new like a new account or something

>  Bed sheets, gonna be a cold night.

>  One can of everything they need to make their thanksgiving dinner.

>  I am replacing all tape with used-up dispensers and rolls, and also stealing all elastic bands and twist ties and twine. Probably won’t be noticed for a while, but when it is...

>  Just like you stole the "s" from "thing" to slightly inconvenience my OCD?

>  All the soap.

>  Every single battery in the house.
It would cause pure mayhem

>  1. That's basically a goose
2. HONK (I would take their important items and put them in a bush.)

>  toothbrushes and tp and also unplug stuff

>  The corkscrew

>  Underwear

>  Funny. I actually used to do things like this as a teenager. Like taking all decorations (Halloween or Christmas) from one lawn and moving them next door or a crossed the street. What I thought was funny about moving the decorations was imagining the owner coming out and noticing all their stuff was in the neighbors yard all set up and bring like WHAT THE FUCK. If I came out to my stuff was moved next door I would probably start cry laughing because I would have learned just how annoying that would be. So the only I stole was time and patience mainly. Also you can be charged with malicious mischief if cought doing this

>  Their porn stash, just one magazine. They can’t ask anyone if they have taken it but will draw that conclusion and feel awkward.

>  Left socks, and 10mm sockets.

>  Deodorant

Toothpaste

A freshly opened soap bar, so they have to open another one (Then put it back beside the new new one!)

Toilet paper

>  Toilet paper, but not full rolls, just like half maybe, so they would have to buy new ones more frequently.

>  Alarm clocks

>  I’d probably take the tissues out of the box, but leave the box so that they’d wait until there was no time, and then realize the sad fate of having to grab a box of tissues.

>  Soap

>  I would wait until the perfect moment, maybe the morning before a busy day or a meeting, and hide the wallet and keys. Wouldn’t steal anything. Just watch them frantically run around their home looking for them.

>  Time. When it looks like you're in a rush I'll get in the way and make small talk, on whatever topic seems like it'll keep you there for the longest. Once you finally get on your way, now doomed to be late, I'll go in your house and steal your TV.

>  Definitely the plunger. One of those things you only need once in a while, and won't even notice it's not there till the critical moment.

>  Something that they basically never use except for when they really need it. I’m thinking flashlights because no one uses them until their power goes out, then they rely on them.

>  A guy robbed me last year and while he took a bunch of expensive shit he also took just the controllers for my ps2 but not the console or games which is fucking lame. 

Also took my 2 minute noodles and shit. 

Wtf man

>  I'd steal this question...from Reddit...because I'm tired of seeing it pop up every 2 days

>  Alarm clock.

>  The WiFi router, mass panic ensues in my house when my WiFi goes down for even a couple minutes these days

>  Their soap trays, just imagine their soap bars slipping all over the vanity

>  I'm just gonna switch salt and sugar

>  Tooth brush

>  Doorknobs.

>  i'd take the bit of the flipflop that goes between the toes

>  The bed

>  I’d steal all their underwear except the old bad fitting ones that are either to loose or to tight.

>  Socks and underwear

>  Definitely their cutting boards, for what if you have to cut something with a sharp knife? You can't use a plate for that, can you now?

>  Fingernail clippers! Every last one.

>  Time

>  Their only pencil so they have to buy more when they realize they can't do their homework! 
#>:D

>  Whatever sheets/blankets/pillows that aren’t already on the bed. That way they would only know what’s missing when their current sheets were dirty

>  Socks but only 1 at a time so when they go to put them on they can’t find the other

>  All of the laundry detergent

>  Their tooth brush!

>  What? I already do that. I'm the reason why one of your socks randomly goes missing.

>  Anything of value I like, provided I ensure the victims all have decent homeowners or renters insurance. I'll leave a spreadsheet of items I steal complete with photographs. So long as I don't take anything of sentimental value, their insurance should make them whole again anyway.

>  Spoons. Because I never have enough. 

And if you don’t get the reference I feel sorry for you.

>  A centimeter off of one leg of a table every chance I get and see how long it takes them to notice

>  Take the Advil or Tylenol so they have to suffer through their headaches and pains untill they get to the store and buy more.

>  All of the really big bowls

>  All their HDMI cords so they can't watch anything

>  shoelaces and belts

people will be stumbling and walking odd all over the place

>  Hair bands and bobby pins

>  Doorknobs

>  The fuses out of their plug sockets. People don’t tend to check there when they’re having problems.

>  The elastic from the top of their socks.

>  Spare batteries.

Oh your TV remote has finally run out of juice? Your lamp won't turn on? Your vibrator ain't giving you the buzz you need?

I have the power to all of them.

>  All the batteries out of remotes/flashlights/implements etc. 

Also, laundry detergent/dish detergent/dryer sheets

>  Phone charger. I left my front door unlocked while walking the dog this week and couldn’t find my phone charger when I got home. Thought it would be brilliant if someone had come inside and only taken that to fuck with me

>  Sink plugs.  You never need them until you need them, and it will delay dishes every time causing horrible roommate drama!

>  Laundry detergent

>  Cups,plastic,glass,etc.They’ll never notice until a good amount of cups,maybe 4-6 cups,are gone.

>  Soap or toothpaste

>  Nothing. But I would turn their house inside-out to make it look like I stole something. They would be wondering what I stole for days.

>  Soap

>  I'm a legend. You've seen my work. You're probably one of my victims. I've never been caught and I'll never quit.

I'm the son of a bitch who takes one of your socks from the dryer.

>  The end bits of a loaf of bread so the other slices go stale really fast

>  Easy. I would steal their bedroom fan. They’ll have a shitty time sleeping tonight😈

>  I would take their batteries. They wouldn't notice they're gone until they need some.

>  Tv remotes
And every time they buy new ones
I take those
I just makes a cycle

>  Pens, hair ties, notepads, socks, measuring cups, toothpicks, etc

>  Half of the soap out of their shampoo bottles. Just enough that they would start to question the shampoo suppliers and the quantity that they put into each bottle so that they would start complaining to their friends. Their friends would look at them like they're crazy, like some sort of overabundance of shampoo using freak.

>  All of the slices of bread except for the first and last pieces.

>  The one cup measuring cup. They'd still be able to measure out one cup by using two half cups, but it would be annoying to do so.

>  Doorknobs. Enjoy not having any privacy, fuckers

>  Antique family photos. 

It's the one thing you can't replace.

>  Their clocks

>  The WiFi router! This actually happened to me, definitely an inconvenience!

>  I'd target things like toothpaste tubes. I mean, they can still brush their teeth.

Or remote control batteries. 

All of their charging bricks... Leave the cables.

2/3 of their toilet paper so it inevitably runs out mid week and you have to go to the store *just for toilet paper*.

One knife from the butcher block so it always has an empty spot or a mismatched handle.

I'd steal the extra length of chain on the ceiling fan so it's just barely out of reach and flip the switch so it spins the wrong way.

>  i would take all of their toilet paper and only leave a little on the roll, so that next time they have to do the dirty, they will run out and have to use a sock or something like that.

>  Their virginity
That would really inconvenience newly married couples

>  Socks, maybe underwear.

>  I just oil up all the doorknobs and steal anything that can be used to clean it up.

>  [The one thing they can't replace](https://youtu.be/0dbJHppgrHc)

>  Remote control to all the t.vs they'll have to buy another one which isnt so hard but itll still be a bitch

>  Their body/hand lotion, this time of the year your skin really needs moisturising!

>  Remotes. But instead of stealing them outright, I would swap them with remotes from other brands.

>  Remove all of their laundry baskets. Already a problem finding them for my dumbass

>  Their tooth paste and tooth brush.

>  I would steal the hair of their toothbrushes. so they have brushes, but it would really suck to use them.

>  Socks and Soap

>  I wouldnt even steal, just come in and slightly rotate their paintings.

>  $1,000.  I just need to find the right mark....

>  The bathroom fan switch. Next person who go poop would be the last one for a while!

>  I'd take their basement light so when they need to go down there they can't

>  Not really stealing but we once went into our neighbours house who had recently pulled a prank on us inside our home.  We swapped all the drawers around in the entire house.  Changed all the clocks. Gladwrapped the toilets. 
If I had to take anything it would be all the toilet paper.

>  I steal all their knives and plve them on the back porch.  They will find them soon but then they have to wash all of them before they can cook.

>  That one bin of leftovers that they were gonna eat when they come back from work. Im also going to still a single battery from each tv remote.

>  All the silverware 
Most people use silverware 3 times a day and it would be inconvenient

>  Do this all the time, let my gym shoes out in the open to dry (boxing gloves too). My thoughts are, go ahead and take them, jokes on you, you’ll have some nasty used gym gear and it’ll finally force me to get new shit lol

>  Door knobs. A swag bag filled to brim with peoples door knobs leaving them stuck in rooms to the end of time.

>  Not really stealing, but I'd set all of their clocks back a few minutes so they'd be slightly late for everything.

>  Shoelaces. And screws that were already loosening on things around the house.

>  Things that start with T

Tampons

Toothpaste

The T on a keyboard 

7ongs

7oo7hpicks

7oas7er

>  The nobs off of all their sinks so they cant wash their hands.

>  Everyones underwear

Ever try to replace one of those without having the burned out one to compare in the store?

Its awful.

>  "Hey you, this is a robbery. Give me the little-silicone-thinghy from your earbuds."

>  four of spades

>  Fingernail clippers

>  Fingernail clippers

>  i’d steal one spoon, one fork, and one knife. looks like you’ll have to run the dishwasher earlier than expected.

>  I would empty the shampoo bottles so they get in, get all wet, try to use soap, and fail.

>  TP

>  Old family photos, because it’s the one thing you can’t replace

>  Car keys. You’d never think they were stolen because people ALWAYS lose them

>  ALL THE TOILET PAPER

EVEN THE REGULAR PAPER

EVEN MAGAZINES, NEWSPAPERS, TISSUES, ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD WIPE THEIR ARSES WITH GOES POOF. 

LET'S SEE WHERE THEIR DESPERATION OF ARSE WIPING LEADS THEM...

>  Tooth brush

>  The chandelier at Tiffany's

>  Their chargers, they'll search for them for days because they think they left them somewhere, but little do they know I now have some new chargers..

>  The coffee!

I woke up at my dads today for a family reunion to find no go go beans.

>  All their disposable dish wear and all their forks.

>  Tampons and TP. Underwear.

>  slowly steal their spoons, until they run out and are forced to get more. After that start stealing the forks one by one, until they get more, and so on.

>  Toothpaste, or if they have contacts, steal the cleaner fluid, so they have to store them in saline.

>  All the twist ties/bread clips/clothespins currently holding things shut.

Enjoy your stale chips.

>  * One of anything that comes in pairs, like socks & gloves;
* Infrequently used tools; small, detachable parts of same;
* Writing equipment

>  Steal the good shampoo, but replace it with Suave

>  Milk, eggs, and beer

>  All the clean dishes

>  Any and all remotes and I am gonna cut whole in any sock I find

>  Burgle a family and find out when they are going on holiday. Then return a week before their holiday and steal all of their passports.

>  The clean towels in their bathroom, so when they forget to look until they get out of the shower, they're forced to freeze.

>  Their milk.
They’ll be all “Where’d all the milk go?” and would have to go to the store and buy more,  and when the milk is about half way down, I steal it again. But only once in a while, so they don’t get too suspicious.

>  The soap

>  Old timey pictures of relatives

>  Tooth brushes

>  the pet's food bowl

>  Hand towels, all of them

>  All of their socks. Need fresh socks, always. At least where I'm geographically located.

>  Replacing their family photos with stock photography.

>  The soap from the bathroom. 

Ever fire up the shower, hop in, get ready to do your thing....damnit!

>  Years ago my buddy left his apartment unlocked so I hard boiled all of his eggs.

>  I'd steal all but the very last bit of the deodorant out of the container it comes in.

>  Their only good set of winter boots.

>  Their last name

>  Antique photos of family members

>  All your scissors. When you need to open a heavy mylar bag of frozen peas or whatever you spend ten minutes trying to find them before you just resort to poking a hole in it with a fork and ripping and tearing like a barbarian.

>  Oh man easy.

First i take all their forks. Then most of the towels. All but one roll of toilet paper. Half the tooth brushes and your milk. And I'll make a sandwich before I leave but I'll leave the bread open.

>  The toilet seat. Someone stole mine yesterday

>  I don't need to steal anything. Just put stuff in confusing places so people think they lost it and spend all day looking for their glasses or their keys or something. Ah but i wouldn't miss the chance to steal scissors because you never remember them until you really need them so..

>  That thing that goes through the hole of the toilet paper roll that holds it on to the holder thing on the wall. Great description, right? You all know what I'm talking about

>  Steal all of their watch batteries, now they have to take a trip to get new ones when their watch dies in 3 years

>  The second item on their grocery lists from all the stores in a 3 mile radius.

>  1 piece of bread

>  The porch light

>  All of their TV remotes except the ones going to peripherals. They can still kind of control the TV, but to do anything specific they'll have to go up and use the buttons on the back.

>  Light switches and flashlights. Because then they have to either get new ones or try to stumble to find a candle and a way to light it

>  Underwear thief strikes again

>  Hairbrushes and combs, anything they use to fix their hair. (yes even the forks)

>  Toilet Paper. Everyone would have to do the "poopy butt shuffle" to find more. Mwahaha

>  Toliet paper, the ultimate inconvenience

>  I can't remember who the comedian was but there was a story about one of his teachers being an asshole and he went out of town so his son threw a party, "which you should never do, if your dad is an asshole." Loads of people showed up, someone broke the pool table in half and someone took a shit on his dad's computer. The police showed up at some point and everyone started chanting "fuck the police" and then someone shouted "SCATTER." A few years later the comedian was over at his mates house and his mate brought him into a secret room at the back of his bedroom. Inside the walls were completely covered with photographs that the friend had stolen from random parties he's gone too. The comedian just said "why?" And the friend replied "because photographs are the one thing, families can't replace"

>  Batteries, I'm not talking batteries from just the remote or something. I mean all batteries. 

And I mean no stone left unturned. If your computer has a battery, I'm taking that shit and you're gonna be left wondering why your BIOS settings are fucked to shit.

>  I steal everyones ketchup

>  The sugar. 

May the rage begin.

>  I'd rip out all the indexes in their books. But first I'd time travel back to the 80's when people didn't have google.

>  All of their forks. Looks like they gotta use a spoon for everything now.

>  Taking his Qtips and replacing them with dollar store brand.

>  All of their spatulas. I'm Spongebob run amok.

>  One of each sock. They’ll probably never figure out they’ve been robbed.

>  Steal one sock from a pair and finally watch as all mothers at last fail to find it too

>  Chargers. They'll suffer for a bit

>  I recently lost one lens of my contact case and I can’t help but think someone stole it to minority inconvenience me

>  Shower curtains. I've moved into apartments that didn't have them already put up, and it's such an annoying inconvenience the first morning you go to take a shower.

>  All their seasonings. Just communist flavours

>  I would steal the bag or box that has the cooking instructions right after opening.

>  Doorknobs, that or unscrew the toilet seats completely but leave them there.

>  Toiletpaper

>  I wouldn’t steal anything, but I’d leave some random thing for them to be confused about. 
“We had a break in!”
“What’d they steal?”
“Nothing, there’s just a lava lamp in my dishwasher.”

>  One half of every pair of socks. Maybe also all their toilet seats idk. Or their phone charger? And I'd possibly go around unplugging everything in their house while I was at it, that seems annoying to a person but also good for the environment and might save a little money on their energy bill depending on how long it takes them to plug everything back in.

>  their sink. they can’t wash their hands or food

>  Probably toothpaste and their shampoo/body wash. Good luck getting clean now!!

>  Family photo albums

>  Doorknobs

>  I'd steal $1,000,000,000 from Jeff Bezos, that'd only slightly inconvenience him.

>  The shower head. You can get around it, totally, but it really sucks.

>  Those handle-things to close the second half of the double windows. You could close the windows but they would be wobbly, slightly tilted and they would often accidentally open.

>  Put the head and feet up on their adjustable bed and take their remote or the tv remotes.

>  10mm sockets

>  Plunger.  You only check to see if you have one when you *really* need one.

>  Their medication so they have to go and get some more from the pharmacy..

>  Nice try, bitter ex-girfriend.

But you won't trick me in to telling you how screwed i feel when my keys or wallet go missing by posting the question in /r/AskReddit

>  The leftover socks after the sock faerie has eaten the first.

>  All the toilet plungers.  They won't even know they are missing until the time of greatest need.

>  Steal a single oven knob. I had a friend that used to do that to mess with people, it really annoys them. I think it's hilarious.

>  id steal 20$ not enough to be a big burden but just enough to be annoying.

>  All their toilet paper, it’s just enough of an inconvenience because they wouldn’t realize until they needed it.

>  They’ll go crazy looking for their smartphones..

>  I steal their shitty ass reposts so nobody has to see them posted every other week

>  When my fiance broke up with the girl she was dating before me, her ex stole a bunch of things from her before moving off to Cali. One of such things was one singular curtain... The one that was beside her bed so sunlight poured in every morning. My fiance says this was more infuriating than having her PS4 stolen because it was an inconvenience - especially when she couldn't find that same curtain to match the other one. We just had to buy all new ones. 🤷

>  Tooth brushes, toilet papers, only 1 out of 2 shoes. They're front doorknob, the TV remote and stuff like that

>  Milk and eggs!

>  I'd steal the etiquettes of all of their underwear so they struggle to put them on the right way.

>  We just fired an employee for stealing ones and quarters(cash business, small change very necessary) along with things like trash bags, napkins, soap and sugar dispensers. No huge amounts of anything were taken, but it finally made sense why we were running out of supplies so fast.

>  IM gunna exchange the good batteries in all the remotes in the guys house with shitty half ass batteries 😂😂
Got this from one of Dane Cooks stand up comedies everyone gives Dane Cook a bad wrap but I think he is absolutely fucking hilarious, look up Dane Cooks b&e and you will not be disappointed, most of his old stuff is old I heard he stole some material but so did Led Zeppelin and look where they are today... LEGENDS

>  Shoe laces all of them, they won’t be able tie their shoe, will have to go get new ones and relace everything themselves

>  A single slice of toast, so that when someone goes to toast their bread, they only have one slice for a two slice toaster

>  Steal their alarm clocks. Tell me whos gonna wake up to them anyway

>  Thier tooth brushes

>  Considering the time of year, I'd steal one bulb out of the strand of lights on their Christmas tree.

>  Well if I'm going by what happened to me last night then just one or the two wiper blades on my car. Had to buy a new set of two so now I have a single one I have no use for.

>  Nail clippers. Occupants would periodically look for them, getting more and more desperate with each futile search until they are scraping frito fingers through bathroom cabinets shelves while they slowly go insane.

>  Just where do you think the missing sock from matched pairs has been going all these years?

Yep, ME! 😜

>  Underpants. Time to go to work, work all day. We needs underpants, hey!

>  Lunch money from everyone who won't suffer by missing out on lunch for the day.

>  Their tooth brush.

>  I’d go to an Apple user’s house and steal their headphones. Not the regular 3mm kind, but the one with the special plug that you have to use for the newer ones. 

If they’re not an Apple user or they have a phone with a headphone jack then I’ll steal all their couch cushions.

>  Someone stole the change holder out of.ny car, had like 2 dollars in it. I don't care about the two dollars, I just want somewhere to put my change.

>  Cords. You're going to immediately notice they are missing and despite losing nothing else they will cause a great impact and annoyance.

>  Someone keeps taking my one good pen and leaving me with a bunch that don't work.

>  All their TP

>  Light bulbs and pillows. Ever had to go to bed without your favourite pillow? And all the lights are off until you get more lightbulbs. Just imagine coming home and trying to turn on a light you k ow worked a couple hours ago, and then every light in the house is like that. Then there are no back ups either.

>  If you were trying to be petty after a bad breakup, this thread would be a good place to get ideas.

>  Finally, an askreddit thread I'm prepared for.

The W key on the keyboard  
The little caps on joysticks  
Radiator knobs  
The caps on the ends of the strings you use to raise and lower the window blinds  
The cardboard tube in all the toilet paper and paper towel rolls  
2/3 of the shower curtain rings, leaving every third ring there  
The caps on all bottles, including soap/shampoo bottles, vitamin bottles, and otc drugs that kids probably can't overdose on

Silverware tray  
Left ovenmitt  
For doorknobs with 3 screws, the bottom 2 screws  
The batteries out of the remote control  
The batteries out of calculators that use batteries (many solar powered calculators that aren't like $3 have a watch battery too to keep it on when there's less light than ideal)  
Any pictures hanging on the wall using a nail? Taking the nail and gently setting the picture down somewhere  
The string for the attic access hatch  
The handles on cabinet doors  
The string-thing whatever it's called that's attached to zippers to make them easier to pull

>  Chair legs but only 1 or three and whatevers left i cut at different  lengths. If ive got infinite time id switch all their light switches and put them back in backwards so that up is off and down is on. Also bread knives and knock anything on the walls crooked.

>  I break and steal the teeth on all combs, leaving just the end teeth, and remove the bristles on all brushes, to include toothbrushes.

>  All the remotes, that'll get em.

>  Would go to a section specifically labeled to have one item and steal all the items that should be in that location

>  Real story, I was at a house party where someone stole all the cutlery and lightbulbs, even the spares. Pretty diabolical.

>  I would steal all their toilets. That is a MAJOR inconvenience.

>  Every single fork. You can kinda get around it by using knives or spoons, but it's still freaking annoying.

>  Their desk drawer but I'd leave most of the things. I would just get tape or a rubber and ofcourse the drawer so they'd basically have everything on the floor

>  A charger


Those things are hella expensive

>  Their shower soap

>  Felix and Marzias jewelry as well as other expensive items... just kidding I wouldn’t do that bc IM NOT A FUCKING MONSTER

You'd be perpetually annoyed, but always blaming yourself for misplacing them. Youd never know it was someone else

>  Sugar, salt, cups, soap,and drink coasters

>  Shoe insoles.

>  All of their lightbulbs, phones chargers, any chargers, wifi router, and all of their spoons. Eating cereal without spoons is awful. On Second thought, all of their milk aswell.

>  You can find more funny answers in one of the other 100 times this was posted...

>  Their bars of soap and shampoo. Having to either go back to the store or deal with unwashed hair.

>  Gas stove burner tops. You can’t just go to a store and buy them. It’s a process.

>  All the toiletpaper

>  Ballpens. I need them myself.

>  Y'all have no creativity. Socks, spoons, the tv remote, a shoe... Think super petty. Think long term. Think, all their nail clippers.

>  I wouldn’t steal, rather, I’d move everything over an inch. Then I’d take the accessories on top (i.e. lamp, vase, candle holder, etc.) and put it on the opposite side of the furniture. I guess I’d be stealing their sanity because they would be losing it trying to find out why everything moved.

>  I wouldn't steal anything, but I would break in while they are gone or sleeping and set their table with their finest dishes and silverware.

I would always set one more place than the number of family members in their house.

>  0.01% of the net worth of the 25 richest. $140 million here I come!

>  Inhaler

>  ill have the biggest collection od used plungers.

>  Milk eggs and butter

>  10mm and 36mm ratchet sockets.

>  Alarm clocks and mailbox keys.

>  TV Remotes, Tinned food labels, batteries, earring backs, cooking utensils that they’d only realise we’re gone in the middle of cooking, blades out of razors, glass microwave rotator, rubber ends of headphones, and toilet paper

>  Can I steal thoughts? Cause I'd like to steal a noun from a sentence someone is going to speak. 
So that every conversation they try to make sounds like

"Hey let's go to...that place"
"...what place?"
"Where we do that thing"
"..."

Why inconvenience 1 when you you inconvenience 2 in a shot?

>  I would pickpocket that one dollar that you forgot about in your wallet. Not very inconvenient but you won't ever have the feeling of finding a missing dollar ever again

>  their shoes. they can’t get anywhere without them and they would be stuck in their house for a while until they get new shoes.

>  All of their hand soap.

>  Tp

>  I'm going to take your stealing tactic and repost

>  Photos of babies or old people since it'd be hard to replace those.

>  I would steal the nutrition info off every food item. 
Hey how many grams of protein does this have? You don't know Karen. nobody does

>  TV remote. 

Someone stole mine from my apartment at a party and I tore the entire place apart for weeks with my roommate. We obviously resorted to blaming each other and searching each other’s rooms thoroughly assuming the other brought it in there by accident. We accused other friends who had been at the party, you know just a casual modern day witch hunt. 

The guy returned it a month later.

>  I have been doing this for the past 3 years. A couple of friends and I started an underground thing senior year of high school called the "Petty Theft Club." And it's exactly that, we steal things that would minorly inconvenience someone. 

We started with a movie poster that was in a storage room in our high school. Then it went to taking one pencil at a time from our least favorite teacher's desk. We stole a couple of match box cars from our physics classroom. A box of razor blades from the biology lab room. We took the spare key to one of the empty cabinets in the chemistry classroom. 

Freshman year of college, over the course of the entire school year, I took 17 bricks out of the middle of the most popular walking path on my campus. I would unscrew lightbulb covers and take only the cover, leaving exposed lightbulbs. At least 2 wet floor signs After the floor was dried up of course, because I don't want anyone to slip.

Now it's my sophomore year in college.  First I took a half-empty container of Tide pods is now mine.  Then I took a San Diego Toreros football when they came to my university to play our football team. I have managed to get plenty of t-shirts from givaways where I should not have gotten a t-shirt. And perhaps my favorite one yet, I stole one of the volleyball team's nicest warmup volleyballs. 

Cheers to many years to come!

>  That's  a good one Here's  my list:
•Piercings and earrings  etc. That irritates  a lot of people also they gonna spent a lot of time searching  on the ground or remembering  the las time they used them.
•Salt. If you cook you're  gonna miss that white thing 3 times a day. Most  of the food taste like sh*t without  salt.
•Underwear. Try to go out without  underwear it's  gonna be awkward  as f*ck all day.

It looks like they are just  dumb stuff  but this  things would make a sh*tty way to start a day. Sorry for the bad English.

>  The leftovers they’ve been eager to dig in to

>  Winter gloves. You can still keep your hands warm in your pockets but good luck opening a door.

>  There bed

>  One shoe from each person that lives there

>  Ingredients that you always think you have at home and don't use often enough to realise you're missing them. Things like vanilla sugar/extract, chicken or vegetable stock, cornstarch. 
Just things you need a second trip to the supermarket for without it being worth.

>  Nail clippers. Never notice it's gone until you need them. When rummaging around for their nail clippers, while a more noticeable theft, steal their squatty potty. If you bought one and still have it against the toilet, then you understand the joy of using one and would greatly miss it when expecting it to be there for your alone time on your thrown.

>  Screws. I'll unscrew everything.

>  Their sanity. I would make it obvious someone broke in and take nothing.

>  Washing-up liquid. Want to do the dishes ? Sounds like a trip to the shop to me.

>  Milk.

If I really hate them, the float from their toilet.

>  I'd take all their lamps, they would be delighted for sure

>  I’m stealing aerators from kitchen sinks. Oh you know your water isn’t bubbly enough now!

>  Not necessarily stealing but I would log them out of everything such as Netflix that they don’t remember the password of.

>  All of their soap

>  I'm stealing that "thing you just put down" but cant find anymore

>  He stole me soap!

Who steals soap?!?!

>  Take their shampoo they’ll have to start putting deodorant in their hair or something

>  I would put all of their knives in a cabinet and ziptie it shut, and then ziptie all of their scissors closed instead.

>  We have someone who does that here in Brazil. He's called Saci-pererê.

>  I would steal most of the strains on peoples toothbrushes. So that they would be able to brush your teeth, Just very poorlt

>  True story, I used to go to a military school in college. We all loved very close together and two of us would share a small room about the size of a closet. 

Anyways we had a thief problem on our deck. This thief never stole anything important or valuable. They only ever stole our body wash and shampoo. If that ain’t the most annoying/inconveniencing thing in the world I don’t know what is. I would come back from PT to have to find my soap gone with near everyone else’s. We would have to use soap from the hand dispenser at the sink to get clean before trying to find the jerk who stole our soap or go buy a new bottle. It got so bad that we began locking our soap in our mini-safe. 

We never did find that thief either...

>  milk and bread (If you're Irish you'll understand)

>  Just all batteries.

When they want to relax in front of the TV, they don't see it coming.
Then! They try it, it doesn't work, then they have to stand up and search for the extra ones.

But hey, I stole them as well.

So in the best (worst for them) case, they have to go shopping instead of chilling on the couch.

>  I once had a fairly rough breakup with an ex that lived in my house. I went to stay with my parents for a few weeks while he packed up and found a new place.

When I moved back into my house, he'd taken all of the tops for my pots and pans.

Oh, and my cat.

>  First, I'd steal the toothbrush. Then two days later, I come back after they bring a new toothbrush I would steal their toothpaste. And evreytime I steal something, I would empty their shampoo.

>  Id go to cali and steal the 100$ bills, no one would notice.

>  All of the cups in the house

>  The twistie tie or plastic clip off the bread bag.

>  I travel the world and steal 1 sock from people, they still think its the washing machine

>  Just one antique photo. Because it’s the one thing they can’t replace. ;)

>  Half of their sneakers.

>  keys. the whole fucking dishwasher and the family pet.

>  True story that happened to me: My work has a no-shoes policy to help preserve the carpeting in the office. Just before I was heading out for the day a coworker mistook my shoes for hers in our closet and left wearing my shoes. So long story short, I ended up having to wait 30 minutes for her to come back with my shoes (At the end of an already long workday).

>  I would steal their remote, wait for them to get a new one, break back in and put back the old remote

>  Their plungers.  They won't notice it for a while, but when the DO notice, it's going to be at a super bad time.  Bonus that the people that live there may not even be the victim.  It could be the person over for a visit who is now stuck with a backed-up toilet and no way to remedy it.

>  Actually... When my parents got broken into the thieves took my dad's underwear (amongst other things). We never understood it and he had to buy new pants...

>  3 Lamps, just enough to cause a problem because how are you going to replace 3 lamps?

>  A more fun response would be someone posting in here the last time this was asked.

>  I was going to say your originality but obviously yours is close to null, because this fucking question is asked every other day. And God damn I'm so fucking tired of seeing the same fucking questions every time I log on this website.

>  I set alarms for a certain time on different alarm clocks hidden around the house wan after a week I go back to their house and put more alarm clocks as needed!

>  One hinge of a toilet seat, so it feels like a roller coaster next time you sit down

>  The screws from doorknobs, but not the doorknobs. Leave the door knobs scattered about in the rooms they don't belong to.

>  Potholders. You never need them until you do and then it's to late.

>  Recovering from these robberies would be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

>  10mm and 13mm sockets out of the toolbox in the garage. Oh wait, they're probably already missing

>  I would zip tie all their doors and pantries shit then zip or all the scissors in the house together closed shut

>  All their batteries, not including the ones in their remotes and controllers. That way when they run dry and look for replacements they spend like, an hour more than necessary just looking for them before giving up and buying more.

>  All the hair bands

>  The toilet seat, its still useable, but you don't really want to

>  I would steal something irrelevant like a vase or a bowl, but I would move all of their furniture like 2cm to the side bc that way they will know something is off but not know what.

>  One shoe from how ever many pairs of shoes they have.

Edit: Never mind, another user posted the same thing before I did

>  Pencils. All of them. Gone, reduced to atoms

>  The bread tie

>  Their hoodie. I can't find my hoodie and I am slightly agitated.

>  The snow brush in their car in the middle of a snow storm.

>  Already paired socks

>  Definitely their Apple remote because that shit goes missing daily but this time it's gone FOREVER

>  All their tablespoons leaving them only teaspoons.

>  Cutterly that is specific

The bread knife, the fish fork, the cake knife.

My dad would fucking implode

>  I’m taking all the pillows. Have fun sleeping!

>  Slightly loosen the screws on their bed frame so that every time they move even the slightest amount all it does is creak and squeak.

Bonus: remove the screws from the frame side of a door hinge and press it back into place, the latch will hold it until the handle is turned.

Then they get left wondering why they suddenly have an entire door in their hands.
(Pulled that one on a job a few years back, hilarious when you and three of the other guys are sat in the room and the door just falls flat inwards and the intern is left looking confused as hell....)

>  The string in their sweatpants.

>  Modify the bottle opener so it breaks when they try to use it, thus making beer consumption temporarily impossible.

>  Enough hot water to leave you with 2 minutes of non icy shower time.

>  The holed caps inside spices so when they pour seasoning everywhere. MUW AHAHAHA

>  i break into their homes and drink all of their milk except for just enough that they try to pour a glass and only get like an ounce of milk.

>  Their insoles

>  I wouldn't steal anything. I'd just ziptie all of the scissors, and then put the knifes in the cabinets and then ziptie the cabinets shut too. Maybe ziptie some other random objects as well.

>  Their toothbrush.  They wouldn't notice until either morning when they would have to go the day with stale breath or night when they would have fuzzy teeth going to sleep.

EDIT:  Just read through the comments.  DAMN a lot of you are evil!

>  Beads that hang in the doorway(dane cook reference)

>  Upvotes

>  Oh damn, this question was so popular on Quora months ago.

>  I'd steal the can opener. Only because our can opener broke last week and I've been opening cans with a hammer and screwdriver and I know how painful it is

>  All the batteries. All the forks and some spoons. Probably rearrange the cupboards. Fill up their vacuum bag. Take their garbage bags. Loosen the light bulbs so they flicker but still kinda work. Definitely take their toilet paper and Q-tips.

>  All the kitchen utensils

>  I'd steal one sock no warm foot winter for you.

>  Their silverware. You can still eat without it but it's annoying

>  The toilet paper. Not the whole rolls, though. Just take the paper in sheets of 4, store them in my pocket to use as kleenex (thrifty!) and leave every roll there with just 1 square left before you get torn up TP.

>  guitar picks. its the most annoying thing to be playing and drop your pick. then poof its gone from existence.

>  The bread knives.

>  Steal the faucets off of everything in their house. Easy way to make inconveniences.

>  lol well when I was in the 3rd grade i was a little bit of a sly bastard. There was this one girl who sit across from me and she always annoyed me, so one day at the end of school when she was in the bathroom, i stole here binder and took all her homework, then but here binder back. The next day she got in trouble in all of her classes. She still annoys me to this day but doesn't know that that was me.

>  All the TP.

>  The bag inside the vacuum. Although that be a bit more than a slight inconvenience.

>  All underwear

>  Half a tub of their newly bought ice cream. That way they won't notice anything missing until they go to eat some and find only half of what they're expecting to find. 

And if I especially dislike the person, I will eat it all save for like two spoonfuls of ice cream. Ice cream bandit.

>  I wont steal anything, I'll just break into your house and make sure the toilet seat is *always warm*

>  This reminds me of a book. It was about a gentleman that used to steal things that people wouldn't realize they were without. Fiction.

>  The thin mints

>  I would steal nothing so they spend hours trying to figure out what i took - Dane Cook

>  You know that one chair everybody has but never uses? Yeah that people notice it when it's gone

>  I would take the milk from their cereal and the bread from their sandwiches

>  Steal all their TP... Though this might be more than a slight inconvenience

>  Family photo albums.

>  Things*

>  Toiletpaper

>  You know those plastic trays your cutlery goes in in your drawers. I'd take those. Make sure to mix up the cutlery pile real good on the way out too.

>  Their toenail clippers

They wont notice theyre gone until they need them

>  Can openers. Practically worth less until you need to open a can.

>  The “s” from the end of “things”

>  A cup.

>  All of their spoons, forks, chopsticks, knives, etc.

As an added bonus, I would take the opportunity to hide their keys, but I’d hide them in their shoes.

>  all their toothbrush’s. it’d be so annoying bc you know you should have like 6 in your drawer but they’re ALL gone

>  Toothbrushes, but only after they had gone to bed for the night

>  scissors. you never think you need em till you do, and you'll never think they were stollen, just lost. and they're so forgettable you won't think to buy another.

>  Take their soap

>  I don't know if this counts, but I'd take all of their Tupperware lids and replace them with lids from a different brand of Tupperware that looks the same but doesn't fit.

>  As a kid I went into my neighbors car trying to find ten dollars. I found 80 but only took the ten I wanted. Does that count?

>  Take the floor tiles and piles away from under their rugs

>  I'd make it obvious that they were broken into and robbed, but leave them a lava lamp. They'd be paranoid as to what I took, and also confused as to why they have a lava lamp suddenly.

>  Tooth brush and tooth paste.

>  The toilet paper in the bathroom. I'd leave any extra that was in the laundry room making the victim call for another family member to fetch the tp.

>  I steal the Banana peels off of bananas

>  The entire convenience store

>  I'd try deduce what kitchen item they used the most. Pots pans the like. And I will take it

>  The toilet paper roller. Now everyone's gotta put their TP on the counter. Hahahaha!

>  Not really related, but I have seen somewhere that in ww2, soldiers would come in some person's house just to switch the salt and sugar jars (put the sugar in the salt jar and vice versa). The person would think they are going crazy because "why would someone break in my house just to switch the salt and sugar?"

Correct me if I am wrong.

-All of the game cases for the Xbox....but left all of the discs. 
-The magazine out of my rifle behind the door but left the rifle

They also left our fridge and freezer open so everything unthawed and spoiled. Our rooms were ripped apart but they somehow missed the $30 in cash and bucket of changeI had sitting on the dresser that they went through.

>  Shampoo. Wouldn’t even notice until mid-shower.

>  Cut like 3 inches off of all their shoelaces and steal that

>  If it's a house in the woods, I'd steal the electrical breaker to their outside lighting so they wonder why it's so dark outside at night. Then they'd have to buy a breaker for $12 at home depot when they do their Christmas lights.

For those fashionistas out there who think the clothes I intend to burn or steal are of little consequence to you, I have a fair knowledge of fashion and I will be stealing your favorite clothes and accessories after I have scoured your photo collection. For those of you who are "18" with webcams and a room set up like a teenagers without photos or other crap on the wall, I will be stealing your over the top bed covers and sex toys.  Any of you with forearm tattoo's and working in the food service industry I'm not quite sure what I intend to steal yet - maybe your glass pipes or microbrewery gear, knives?

Also change their clocks to different times.

They'll think they have whatever beans they need for dinner but nope, I stole them... It could take days or weeks after my burglary until they'd notice

>  The TV remote.
But after a few days put it somewhere in the open. Like the coffee table or wherever you would keep a remote.
Then after another few days steal the remote again.
The whole house will be in utter chaos trying to find the remote. Brother will fight brother. Wives and husbands will divorce. Sisters will claw each other eyes out. Cats and dogs will marry.
And it will be because of me.

>  All the basic hygiene products. Body wash, shampoo, toilet roll.

>  All the toilet paper, so if the person is single he's gonna have to either wash his ass or go to the story dirty.

>  My boyfriend and I bought a Dyson vacuum that has a long metal tube to connect it so that you can vacuum the floors or tall places or something. We have looked everywhere for this thing. We had it like a week ago and we moved a week before that, so it’s not like the house is a mess. We just put everything back where it goes. He’s having more of an existential crisis about it than I am but it’s still confusing. So, the long vacuum tube is what I’d steal to be inconvenient

>  I wouldn't steal anything instead I'd go through and put things in there  "proper place".

For example can't find your keys?  There always on the coffee table cuz that's where you toss em when coming in from work right?  Where did you put em? Did they fall and are under the table? No. 

Check the key rack. 

What about your wallet? Eh you just leave it in your pants from the day before or toss it by you bed when you change. Crap... where did you put it now.... did you leave it at work?  Or worse the bar from last night?  You call the bar if its still open....nope no wallet got turned in..... ughhh now your gonna have to cancel your cards and apply for new ones.... you'll do that later on your lunch break. 

Wait did I really leave it in the catch all tray my significant other bought for the house that I said I wouldn't use because thats "unnecessary"? 

You ask your significant other. 
They hadn't touched your wallet...

>  Don't steal anything, just move every thing 2 inches to the right so they stub their toes.

>  All the batteries in their house.

Remotes, fire alarms, the spares in the freezer.  The beeps from the alarms would be maddening and I guarantee they wouldn't check everything before they went to get replacements.  It would means two, maybe there trips.  It would run their whole day.

>  Their milk, the whole carton.

>  Antique photos. It’s the one thing you can’t replace

>  Sorta relevant story:
When my sister and I were 12 & 13 our family lived in a home owned by our aunt. (Mother's Sister) Aunt one day decides she wants to move back into the house, & with very little notice tells our family of 5 to find another home. My sister and I are just old enough to know we are mad on behalf of the family and we are going to payback Mean Auntie! So our last day there, we removed every single light bulb in her house and smash them on the side of her garage! We were so proud of ourselves for it! We knew she would be coming back from an international trip late and wouldn't be able to see! Huzzah! 20+ years later same Auntie and Sister and I are talking about what we did. We feel silly and Mean Auntie said, "I knew you guys did it. I thought it was very cute of you. Fighting for your family." And we all laughed.

>  Here in Costa Rica they take everything they can get away with. Everything is carried for quite a distance, so they use some young men who are very strong. Vehicles normally wait for them across the valleys. The first thing they grab is electronics, after that everything else is pretty much the icing. Electronics and tools are sold, and everything else is distributed amongst family members. Nothing is sacred!

>  True story, a few years back my now husband's car was broken into and among other things they stole, they took his middle counsel cupholders. The car was a stick so you could see the inner shaft. You dont realize how much stuff you put in your cupholder till its gone. Many of coin, slushies and misc items were lost or spilled.

>  All of the toothpaste except enough for half of one use. They’ll be disappointed in not enough toothpaste but also realize they have to go get more.

>  I went to an open mic night yesterday, and someone was telling me a story about when they went to a house party. The hosts were sad about what happened after and how much stuff was destroyed, but also that some of the old family photos were missing. So the guy who's telling the story went on to talk about how he went over to one of his friends' houses a few years later, and that friend showed him a secret room filled with stolen family photos. Because it's the one thing that you cannot replace.

Make it obvious that someone broke in and rustle some things around, but don’t actually take anything, so they spend forever wondering what got stolen.

That being said I'd steal all the dishsoap so they have to wash dishes with handsoap/bar soap.

>  Every day I will come by and steal a single dollar. Only a single dollar at a time.

>  No one will see this because I'm too late but I have winter boots that only lace up, no zipper. They are knee high so I can't get them on or off without untying them most of the way. I one time found just my right boot completely laced by the heater, I don't lace my boots up after I take them off that would be stupid. I asked my boyfriend who I live with if he did it and he swears he didn't and I believe him mostly because I asked about a million times and he's not really a practical joker. I still do not know who did this. This was two years ago but sometimes I still think I'm crazy. Apparently it was just someone like the inconvenience burglar.

>  All the air in the world. So they and everyone else die, causing slight inconvenience

>  The right shoelaces. 

No specific reason for just the right, but it would annoy the hell out of me, and I figure it would anyone else as well.

>  I'd take the last one of everything, it'd require some sort of special power so I'd know when, but everytime they took the second to last of an item, I'd come in and steal the last, meaning when they went to get another thinking "it's ok I've got one left" they'd actually be completely out.

>  All the soap, shampoo, and toothbrushes in the house.

>  One side of a sock. Although it already gets lost in the laundry.

She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

The only item we'll look for over a period of days; before ever admitting the TV box can be operated without it. 

Definitely a remote.

We used to mail random items to one another. There was this green stress ball. 

It's been to more countries than most people have been States. 

It smells like absolute shit.

>  The metal rod that holds up the toilet paper. Just the rod. The coffee filters. Every one of them tho. They have almost everything but still can't make coffee or hang the toilet paper.

>  Their Alexa. No explanation needed.

>  Shoe laces, if there’s time I’d replace them with overly stretchy yarn of the same color.

>  This question.

>  The cap off of their toothpaste, and the roller that goes in the TP holder.

>  All the shelves in the fridge. Might even snag a shower curtain or two on my way out if the mood strikes.

EDIT: alrighty, maybe just a shelf or two.

>  I would steal the air pump covers, and I mean all of them.

>  i would go in at night and steal all their toilet paper. When they notice at their morning shit its already too late.

>  The sugar

>  The whole booty

>  All of the staples in the house. They wouldn’t notice until it was too late. Same story with uncommon batteries ( C, D, 9V, etc).

>  I’ll steal their sense of accomplishment like my bitch ex wife did to me

>  Toothbrushes. They probably have 3 more under the sink but the mystery would drive me insane.

>  I leave just enough peanut butter for one toast, but they gotta work for it

>  I would take half of their batteries. Nothing much, but they would have to sacrifice half of the stuff that needs batteries to power the other half.

>  Their underwear

>  The refrigerator light. They will think it's burnt out and be even more freaked out its just missing lol

>  The wifi router cord. The individuals will be reseting every wifi connected device in hopes to get the WiFi connected only to realize they wasted the whole day trying to connect to something that doesn't have it's cord and after that time they'll have to had used their data to search for a way to buy a cord for it.

>  One sock from every pair. And since I'm a good thief I will write 'Juicy ', "Don't handle when wet", "Like what you see" and other messages on their underwear.

>  THEIR FAMILY!

>  All of the electrical sockets in their home

>  Mailbox 
 
The pull string to the attic stairs 

The weight scale 

Couch cushions

>  Snip the fibers on their toothbrushes. Not short enough to be useless, but just short enough to make brushing your teeth uncomfortable.

>  Limes. You only buy limes if you need then in the next few days and they're small enough that they wouldn't cause suspicion if lost

>  I'll steal all the eating utensils. Muhahahaha! They'll have to eat soup with their hands in sadness and when their done and looking for a napkin, they'll be devastated again once they realize I've stole the napkins too! So they'll have to wipe their hands on their clothing making everything they brush against covered in soup. They go to the store to get utensils and napkins but they accidentally bump into a stranger and get soup on them, the stranger bumps into another stranger and gets soup on them. Soon everyone is covered in soup and I am a satisfied burgaler.

>  This happened to me once. A shitty housemate got kicked out and he stole some random stuff.

A pack of belts for my shitty vacuum, lots of my forks, he tried to steal the book I use as a monitor stand but I found that in his shit and took it back. He took a power cord an all in one pc so it's not just a regular pc power cable, some cups, lids to my tea mugs, my bird feeder, some games, my tv remote, and who knows what else.


I ended up with like 10 thermal pizza delivery bags he stole from work, a bunch of random bullshit like mineral samples, a 30ft long hdmi I kept, the rest I took to the dump.

>  There girlfriend.

>  The peanut butter..... Or the jelly

>  The batteries from everything that requires them. 
They can even keep the new unused ones, the thought of wondering why the product won’t work and then wondering where the batteries went would be enough.

>  TP

>  Hmm... If I had to think, all of their napkins and paper towels.

>  I'd steal just enough soap from the soap dispensers that they would have to tilt it at like a 45° angle just to get a tiny bit out

>  Cut the bar of soap and take half of it.

>  All of the tampons. 

They're expensive so worthwhile to me, and the other person there now has to do the rolled up toilet paper thing until they buy more tampons.

>  Shoe strings

>  The TV remote.

They'll never believe eachother and never suspect that it was stolen

>  The remotes. They'll turn the whole home over to find them... But never do. Mwuhahaha!!

>  
A piece of wood trim from each section inside their house. They will never be able to get it to match again and will have to redo all the trim in the house.

(This actually happened at a foreclosed house by an angry former owner. My friend bought the house and had to re-trim the entire thing.)

>  kettles. 

british people love tea, so if I stole teabags then they could just nip to the shop to get more, whereas stealing a kettle means it's a slight inconvenience because they then have to boil water on the stove or then they have to pick a new kettle from the argos catalogue or wilko's

>  Toilet plungers... they won’t know til they need ‘em... then it’s too late, someone’s gonna find out!

>  Imma steal all their windows

>  Butter, cooking spray and oil.

>  Their time. Can you spare a minute to hear about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?

>  take the milk from their fridge so they can't make cereal

>  Hand soap

>  One screw from each doorknob, so it rattles, and won't open or shut properly.

>  The doorknobs

>  The cable tightner thing, that ties your internet cable to the where your internet comes from. This will piss of people who complain about short connections, and sudden drop of internet connection.

>  My uncle IS one, and we're having a genuine but relatively mild feud at the moment. He has a key to my place because it was his and moved out, and he wants me out but it has to be of my Ken volition. Anyway, he took the salt and pepper the other day. I couldn't even be bothered mentioning it to him. I've just been eating really bland food for a fortnight in silent martyrdom.

>  Their alarm clock.

>  Take the lint collector tray from the dryer. Have fun going to the laundromat while you wait 2 weeks for the replacement part to arrive

>  Toiletpaper

>  All of their spoons, except one teaspoon. Hope you set enough time aside for everyone to eat a bowl of cereal, one after another, with a teaspoon

>  The most used wrench attachment or drill head

>  A piece of wood from their fireplace, just a single piece of wood

>  Don't steal the knives, just make them blunt and steal the knife sharpener

>  I'd take all the peanut butter in the house (leaving behind the empty containers).  Leave the bread, leave the jelly.  Just take the peanut butter.   Repeat every couple of weeks.  That way, they can't figure out how they keep running out.

If they're not a peanut butter person, whatever they use in place of peanut butter.  For some people, this might mean taking something completely different, like mayonnaise.   The ingredient I'd be looking for is whatever is an essential component in *their* sandwiches.

>  If my victim is female, I'd steal all her foundation overnight. Liquid, powder, cream, sunscreen..anything that can be used as a foundation on the face before leaving the house in the morning.

>  I start by stealing there underwear, there ass will be allowed to breath. All there chargers and light bulbs except a single solitary one? Gone. Finally I will pull the greatest stunt by stealing one left foot. They will suffer.

>  The battery of everything you own : from your phone, to your console. From your tv remote, to your clock. You won't see how time pass fast when you're not checking it. And just for pure evil : i would set the time 1h30 in advance.

>  All of their eating utensils.

>  I steal 98% of the toothpaste, and leave it almost empty each time they buy a new one

>  Phones. Lol well maybe not slightly.

>  All of the toilet paper except the one that has maybe just enough to get one more full use. The person would either have to make a decision before if they have enough or leave the comfort of the home bowl advantage to go to a vistors arena.

>  I’m stealing all the switch knobs off lamps, cinnamon, and putting all chargers I find in the house in someone’s bed room so they get blamed for taking it

>  I had one of these for a while. He would go into my laundry and shed. He stole shit that inconvenienced me including: tools, wetsuits, beer, butter, cheese, half smoked cigars, my lighter, and a bag to put it all in.

>  I would wash down all the soap they had

>  Lightbulbs. They wont notice until it's too late!

>  The other day I was googling wendy's chili sauce  packets and the first result was someone selling a lot of 50 on ebay. I don't know why but I want to rob them.

I actually did that to someone once. Trust me, they deserved it

>  Their honey dipper. Annoying when you don't have it, but not significant enough that you can't get by without it.

>  All the teaspoons...no way to make a decent cuppa without the right spoon

>  The first bite of their gum

>  I would steal every battery I can put my hands on.

>  their dog

>  Misplace their plates, utensils, and cups

>  Think I’d just switch the toilet rolls the other way once a week somehow, they’ll destroy each other

It was about an ex burglar who would with permission break into someone's home and after they would give them a free security system then after try it again. Well before he was an "ex" burglar he would steel tv remotes just to be a douch bag.

>  I take the soap

>  Baby teeth.

>  UNUSED Condoms, all day, every day. If you realized you were out of condoms and went to the store for a new box, boom! Those xs’s are gone before you leave the parking lot. The one in your wallet, gone. The one you are not done using, gone. How else am I gonna build up my ballon collection?

>  Plug 1 side bit of the electric socket (US) or plug the ground up.

>  In college, my roommate Kelly and I would do laundry at our friend Steve's house down the street. He had given us a key so we could go when he was at work (big mistake). Over the course of about a month, we would steal little things every few days...a framed photo, a lamp, etc. Stuff he wouldn't really notice IMMEDIATELY, but something would just seem...off. But we would then put the stolen item in OUR house (and he was at our house almost every night), somewhere visible, but not super obvious. We started with small items but eventually started taking things that would be more noticeable. He would come over, and we'd see him looking around, a little confused, but still not getting it. It wasn't until we took a 3 x 3' painting that had been hanging in his living room and put it over our fireplace that he finally figured it out. And he said that the sad part was that he really didn't notice that when he was home, but once he saw it in our living room, the pieces all started fitting together. He hadn't noticed the framed photo of his family sitting on our mantle, or his favorite coffee mug next to the coffee pot (which he used often). He said that he had thought he was starting to go crazy, but couldn't figure out what it was. He thought it was funny, at least, but got his revenge when he took our clothes out of the washing machine and replaced them with an entire load of his socks and underwear. But playing the long game is a great way to inconvenience someone, and possibly make them go a little insane.

>  Fingernail clippers

>  Their toothpaste not the toothbrush just the paste. So they have to go to the store in the morning just to get toothpaste.

>  Let's say a family has 5 family members... I would steal all of their plates, chairs, forks, spoons, knifes and so on and only leave 4 of everything

>  Cups. They shall drink from bowls.

>  The name says it all

>  Their milk so they can’t eat breakfast. And I unplug their tv cables

>  Fun fact: my brother G (12) and I M (14) were shit heads back in the day and we decided to burglarize a home in our neighborhood. We stole booze, primarily, and I think maybe a few trinkets but nothing of any significant value. While plundering, I hear G call out. 

G: "M...M! You know those little hammer things that judges have?"
M: "Yeah, it's called a gavel, why?" 
G: "Come here!" 

Sure enough, there was a commemorative gavel which celebrated this judge for having served with integrity and so forth. So we took that. I don't know what happened to it, but surely the statute of limitations has passed by now. 

We ended up being busted a month later for another stupid crime. 14 year old me was an idiot.

>  MOST of the forks in their silverware drawer. 

Not all of them, because they would immediately notice they have no forks and go and buy some cutlery. Just like, 65% of their fork supply, so they dont have enough to meet their household's usage but also dont notice that anything is missing until it all comes to a head one evening when somebody says "what the hell happened to all our forks?"

>  The pump from hand soap dispenser

>  Peoples time, by reposting this question

>  All of their babana peels.

>  It's not stealing but unplug all the electronics in the house.

>  Cups

>  Floss. When you need that shit you need that shit...

>  Why take when you could leave something instead? Grab some dog shit, and just leave small smears all over the house. The underside of door handles, the back of the fridge handle, plug sockets, places like that. And then smear the back of every radiator in the house. Even if they manage to clean every touchable surface, they will still have to take the radiators off the wall to clean them, or the house will smell like baked shit.

Take nothing, leave a memory they will never forget.

>  All the spoons in their house that's literally the first I thought of 🤣

>  I wouldn't steal anything, just unscrew every screw I could find about 3/4 of the way out

But I’d probably take the shower curtain(s)

>  Their big toenail clippers, so they have use the small ones on their feet.

>  All the plates, cups etc. And when they buy more, I'll steal them too.

>  Toothpaste, laundry soap, dish soap, deodorant, shampoo

>  Corkscrews

>  The soap

>  Change all their clock times

>  Doorknobs

>  The plungers.  They wont realize its gone until there's shit on the floor.

>  Utensils.

>  their bowls

>  Socks. I used to do this to my roommate when her messiness was frustrating me. She would complain that she could never find socks and I’d suggest she clean up and then she’d probably find them. I eventually confessed this to her.

>  Every and any door in there house I'm cutting it in half and taking 1 half. (dose not mean horizontal cut could be diagonal cut)

>  You should all read The Stranger in the Woods, about Christopher Knight, the "North Pond Hermit" in Maine. He spent more than 20 years stealing random little things for his mere survival out in the woods. People would arrive at their cabins to find their boots or propane tanks missing. I would basically do exactly what he did!

>  Nothing, I've already stolen their sense of security in their own home by breaking in

>  My ex was such a petty bastard he stole the base off my TVs. I raged about that for about 3 years until I could replace them.

>  All but the last tiny bit of laundry soap, dish soap and fabric softener. I'd leave enough to wash like two pairs of socks and a fork, LOL.

>  The pull tabs from all the soda and beer cans. All the writing utensils except yellow highlighters. Replace all the soap in the dispensers and refills with water.

>  Kitchen cabinet door and drawer knobs - still probably get in but piss you off every time you have to get something

>  As a young kid I stole a steering wheel out of a Chevy Suburban. I prided myself on stealth entry and exit, and locked the vehicle when I was done. So I've always wondered what the owner's face looked like when they unlocked the door (old school manual style) presumably to go to work in the morning, to see that their steering wheel was missing.

That’s it, just the small gas can.

So with that in mind, good luck finding the garlic powder, OP!

>  I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

>  Every other glove. Ill take all the right hand gloves since most people are right handed and they will use that hand and freeze it. Come winter time the whole family will suffer!!

>  Q-tips to make them suffer after showers

>  Not theft, but... my grandma, whenever she was mad at my grandpa, used to sew a stitch line into his socks, an inch up from the toe, so he couldn't get his foot quite all the way in. Always seemed rather brutal.

>  I steal all clocks.

>  The toastie maker they haven't used since 2006 but recently found and was planning on having Ham Toasties for every meal for the next week.

>  Underwear!

>  Old antique photos, because it's something they can never replace.

>  The bathroom door. Just pop it off the hinges and take the whole thing. Makes life incredibly uncomfortable and awkward, but only mildly inconvenint.

>  I'd pour all of their milk down the sink.

>  The tv remote. They’re gonna go insane ripping apart the house to find it.

>  Every other peice is bread in the loaf, that way their sandwiches don't fit quite perfectly

>  The TV remote. I'd love to watch the family go nuts in a trust war.

>  Soap

>  I steal your scissors. The reason is that you won't realize they are gone until you need them.

>  Their souls. It is not like they're of any consequence to them and I can get a real sweet deal from the Devil. Just one hundred souls for a bag of gummi bears!

>  I’d remove all your lawn gnomes/furniture and I would set them next door at the neighbors house. 
You know like say the neighbors walking path is to dark and one neighbor has those solar yard lights. I’d “donate” a few lights  to the neighbor with the dark walking path.

>  The new toilet paper roll in the bathroom, so that by the time they realize it's gone, they already have to do the shimmey butt clench to get more. Or they have to shamefully call someone to get them a roll

>  The doorknobs.

>  Their coffeemaker. Go run to 7-11 for your coffee!

>  The remote they will just think they forgot where they left it and will be looking all day

>  all their hand soap

>  The corkscrew. Muuuhhaaaha.

>  Fingernail clippers and tweezers, they’re not gonna need them until they really need them. And u know how pissed u can get when you can’t find them when you have a hangnail or your nails start lookin grody

>  Replacing their perfectly ripe bananas with rotten ones.

>  I always thought what would bother people the most and then ...I saw it ..toilet paper

>  Turn all the clock back an hour... "ahh another hour till the interview"

>  I would make it really obvious there was a break-in but only steal "steal this album" buly System of a Down

>  A small hole i cut out from each of their clothes

>  Doorknobs

>  All toothbrushes, floss, mouthwash, and gum. I’d leave the toothpaste behind. Your breath might smell minty, but those teeth are going to feel gritty and gross until you can get to a convenience store.

>  The garlic from an Italian family

>  There milk not all of it but just enough for them to think they need more

>  Instead of stealing I would superglue their shower drains shut so if they try to shower it floods

>  Their key rings, not the keys themselves just whatever they use to organize/keep them together.  Like now they have a bunch of loose keys and having to go out to buy key rings.  Except you’ve never thought of just buying the rings before so you have no idea where to get them.  So before you can even go to the store you have to google “ Where to buy key rings” and after scrolling past all the amazon listings you realize that no physical store just sells the ring.  So now you have to buy a ring that’s packaged with a bracelet/charm that your probably just going to throw away.  So on top of your entire morning being derailed now you have deal with the guilt of being wasteful to.

>  Plot twist, OP has a key to their ex's house and is going to do as many of these as possible to get back at them.

>  Towels and shaving cream. Had an ex move out and take both. First shower I had after was definitely slightly inconvenient.

>  I'd continously steal every hygiene product they own. I'm talking toothbrush, toilet paper, floss, menstrual pads, towels and every other thing under the rainboe but one by one and if they buy new stuff I steal it again.

>  Their soap.

>  All of the doorknobs

>  All their light bulbs and replace them with burned ones, especially the refrigerator and the overhead garage bulb... but I’d leave the ones by the entry ways to confuse them even more.  Maybe after a couple trips to the circuit breaker they’ll figure out what happened.

>  I'd sneak into their rooms at night and steal their fresh underpants so they would wake up in the morning realizing they only have used ones left

>  The little measuring scooper for when you're making coffee. Or is that actually a serious offense?

>  I'm taking TP, paper towels, trash bags including  the stash of grocery bags, socks and underwear. And possibly all the toothbrushes or just the toothpaste and mouthwash if it's a single person.

>  Take there hair band

>  Every single writing utensil

>  All of the bed sheets in the house.

>  I lost my passport once and that process to get a new one was absolutely ridiculous, so...passports.

>  Doorknobs

>  their doorknobs

>  Imma steal their virginity

>  A single knife every week and replacing it with a spoon.

>  I’m stealing all the air in the house first of all I’m coming in hot like Kirby back in 06’ smash brothers creating chaos .. have you seen sponge bob when they went to sandys ? Exactly !

>  I'd replace one of the batteries in the remote with a dead one, steal the rest of them, leave behind more dead ones but before i do that i'd reprogram the remote to not address the tv and make it point to another device if there is one. To top it off, i'd rearrange the numbers on the tv spacing them out with numbers pointing to static and finally i'd set the brightness to be a bit too dark.

>  Their body towel

>  The hand towels in their restrooms

>  One airpod (or whatever variant they have)

>  ACTUAL STORY ABOUT TIMES I GOT ROBBED: sorry on mobile. Back story: the land lady for this larger real estate company got promoted to one of their other properties. Company hires a new land lady (LL from now on). Landlords always get an apartment with the office attached. They have to follow the same housing rules as everyone else plus keep regular business hours, whatever those were. No more than 3 adults per unit & 2 per bedroom (so 1 beds could have 2 adults, 2 beds could have 3 adults, but not 4), all must be related by blood or marriage, no felons, no sex offenders, must pass credit check. They also have to respond to maintenance complaints and provide 24 hour notice before entering an apartment (except emergency). Pretty standard. 

"Break" in 1: found a used condom on my bedroom floor. Was too big to fit my partner at the time. "Okay, maybe it expanded some how and we didn't clean it up." Ignored it 

Robbery 1: stole a Gatorade from my fridge and left a half drank one on my window sill. "Maybe I drank more than I realized" Ignored it 

Robbery 2: another Gatorade. Some food. "Weird, but who would do that?" Called partner who lived 2 hours away. He hadn't been over for a few weeks. Ignored it.

Break in 2: Stuff was moved but again, no money, no electronics were taken. Ignored it. 

Break in 3: A keepsake I had in a special box in my living room was on my bedroom windowsill. NEVER would I have placed it there. 

So I go banging on the office door, about 8 pm. Demanding to know if they (LL, LL's wife or maintenance) had been in my apartment. I already had documented issue with them coming in with no notice while I was at work. Asperger's moment but it was "to fix the dishwasher" or other excuses. I needed it fixed so I was like okay, but you have to tell me. They said they hadn't today so I called the cops and told them. (Cop lost it when I told him about the condom being too big. He tried so hard to keep it professional lol) 

Eventually chocked it up to the previous tenant was trying to find something left behind. Made sense. They had to evict the guy for sanitation reasons. Took 6 truck bed loads of garbage to clean the place. Issues continued to the point I was blocking the door and leaving through a window unless they started to use that entrance too. I felt there was nothing I could do. 

Long story short - Maintenance was LL's felon, registered sex offender ex-husband. He was living in the office apartment with LL and her new wife. He was using the maintenance keys to enter people's apartments when they were gone. This is why they refused my repeated requests to change my locks, then said they would if I paid a 50$ installation fee. Original land lady said that wasn't a real fee Company charges. So they would have just pocketed it and kept entering whenever they wanted. 

How did I get it to stop? A realtor for Company came in to the Subway where I worked at the time and I thought he was a big wig with the apartments so I just let lose all of above, how they had refused to fix my mailbox door (which was leading to mail theft), how they completely removed the door after repeated requests (which meant the post office refused to deliver my mail), things being stolen off my doorstep, the creepy old guy who walked around in his underwear and leered at me (young and alone then), I could never get a receipt for my rent (original land lady's assistant has pocketed a month's rent which I had to replace and 100$ in late fees), the office was never open, maintenance was living with LL and wife, and other problems I was having. 

I unloaded months of frustration and fear to this poor man on his lunch break. He was just kind of frazzled and explained he worked in real estate sales but took my information to pass to the leasing team. They were moving out by the time I got off shift that day.

>  Every corkscrew I can find.

>  I would steal just one cord from the back of there TV. They will never know which one to replace from the mountain of other cords.

>  Time of course.

>  Nailclippers

>  All TV controllers they will blame each other and search for hours

>  I'm going to strip just one wire in every single cable bundle in the house. You'll be replacing individual cables for years

>  Toliet paper and towels

>  Steal seasonal clothes. e.g. steal jackets in the winter or tank tops in the summer.

>  I am taking all your toiletpaper.

>  The shower mat so their carpet gets wet. They then get wet socks.

>  The man lay sobbing on the floor next to his shoes. Cries out in terror *“WHO THE FUCK STEALS SHOE LASES?”* at that exact moment I begin to laugh maniacally from just outside his door. And scurry off to repeat the process. 
Will they ever put an end to my reign of terror?

>  I am not quite sure there's not some kind of mischievous spirit around here that likes stealing those pins that are used to keep your doorhandle in place. Not just the smooth ones, even the ones with external threading that you screw in (with an allen wrench or a screwdriver).

>  All the light bulbs, as it's winter thell have to use there phones to go to the toilet, only to find someone else has nicked all the loo roll, that's if the doors aren't closed cause someone's nicked the door handles as well.

>  steal their pot covers (not sure what they are actually called, english not my first language) from the kitchen and replace them with ones that are slightly smaller and just fall into the pots

>  spoons because you no other utensil is like it

>  All their extension cords

>  I would switch around the bags of cereal and put them in other cereal boxes

>  I’d steal all their chargers and wires. Not the end of the world, but it’s only a matter of time till they need jt

>  Their silverware but like one piece at a time spread out over a while

>  Doorknob

>  I’d replace good milk for milk expired by two days..... old enough to gamble taking a swig and seeing if it’s sour

>  Family photos.

It’s the one thing you can never replace.

And I’m new in town.

>  The remote, who would even believe it?

>  Toothpaste, toilet paper, deodorant, dishwasher soap, laundry detergent. Damn im evil.

>  Their soap. They go in the shower expecting the soap to be there, and then they’re stuck in the shower with no soap.

>  From the kitchen I take the 1 tsp and 1/2 tsp measuring spoons but leave the 1/4 tsp. 

Similarly I take the 1 cup and 1/2 cup measuring cups but leave the 1/3 and 1/4 cup measuring cups. 

Then I set all the digital clocks forward by 7 minutes. They will still all read the same time but they will be off just enough to be noticeable. So I’ve either stolen the moments it takes them to readjust them or I take all the moments where the person has to do math in their head to remember the real time is 5:46 and not 4:53. Furthermore when they leave in the morning they will be 7 minutes early for their bus. Not late so they miss the bus. They will be early so they have to stand in the cold waiting.

>  Their teabags

>  The leftover food from when they went out last night.

>  Toilet roll,I would leave enough to give you false hope.

Edit....
Also your remote for the tv in the bedroom, that feeling of a night time when you get in bed to watch some tv but can't find the remote is another type of frustration

>  Bacon. I'm stealing their fucking bacon.

>  One spoon, fork, knife, plate, cup, and bowl from their nice set of dishes. Christmas is ruined!

>  all the toilet paper until there is that last little bit left that’s never enough.

>  Well I'd just do what my dogs do; steal one sock from each pair


Still don't know where she put em but I'm sure whoever lives in my old house probably found em

>  I'd drink all their milk except for a small splash too small for a bowl of cereal or a coffee.

>  I might be too late, but I would steal their children than sell them on amazon

>  I'm stealing their soap. Basic hygiene will deal with them generously.

>  Toilet paper, dish washing tabs, trash bags, empty out all cleaners and put just water in.

DIRTY UP THE WORLD! MUAHAHAHAH!

>  The soap.

>  Steal their magnets. Possibly even from their electronics.

>  I’d just unplug random stuff like TVs and lamps.

>  15 minutes from their day.

>  Got burgled this year, the fucker took the amazon fire remote but not the device in the tv. Slightly inconvenient! He also took loads of other shit too. But this really took the biscuit!

>  Toothbrushes. They'll go mad in the morning.

>  Nailclippers,hairbrushes, and the ice cream scopp. You always forget them when you need it most.

>  Seal their shampoo. Think how annoying it would be to be completely naked and wet and realize you only have conditioner.

>  The money they’d saved to take their kids somewhere and do something fun.

>  I posted this months ago. Check my post history if you don't believe me. Lol. It is a good one tho.

>  All of their soap, shampoo, dish soap, sponges, and any other house cleaner lol. Oh and all their toilet paper

>  Tampons they wouldnt notice until they NEEDED them

>  Well someone broke into my car, didn’t touch my nice sunglasses or radio, just took my iPhone cord. So....that

>  100 million off of every billionaire squeaky clean and they have to come up with a reason as to why it’s missing.

>  All the batteries in the house, my mom added she would take all the soap

>  All of their milk except for like, half of what they need for cereal. And then all the spoons.

>  I’d bring a sewing machine and alter all their underwear two sizes smaller.

>  Remove the light fuses in the morning and watch them all running round like headless chickens in the evening

>  Lamp pull chains.

>  This feels... familiar.

>  Dishwasher, there dish’s will never be very clean, and dishwashers are expensive

>  Their bread. What are they going to do now? Bread goes with everything.

>  I will shave off every leg of each furniture by 3 inches. Then I will add them to their bed.  I won't be really stealing anything, I'll just be taking their sanity.

Edit: someone already had a similar idea, fml

>  Say goodbye to those figures on your dashboard bitch!

>  Frist the weapons and tech and after that the rest of the things cause they won't know who did it and if they did they can't do nothing

>  Your garlic aioli

>  Towels. What are you gonna dry yourself with now huh?

A paper towel?
Oops, that still a towel.

>  Some1 stole the little spinny bit to slightly inconvenience you.

>  Keys, cleaning utensils (tooth brush, nail clippers, etc.), and phone charger

>  The s off 'things'

>  My victim will wake up thirsty. Naturally, they'll head to the fridge to grab a bottle of water. However, they'll notice that all the water is gone. Not just water. Juice, milk, soda, anything that you could drink with the thought "this will quench my thirst" it's all gone. They think to themselves "alright, I'll have to drink tap water then" so they look around for a glass but they're also all gone. They continue to look everywhere for it until eventually they find a single glass in a random place where it's not supposed to be. They finally get ready to put some water in it. The knob on the faucet's gone.

>  I would probably steal all plug sockets (apart from the fridge/freezer to inconvenience everyone. I was originally going to remove the base for the kettle but that would only inconvenience fellow Brits.

>  The second hand of all the clocks

>  Toothbrush. They would be inconvenienced just enough to make it annoying.

>  Remote controls, utensils, small cups (so that they can only drink from giant mugs and bottles),  their fruit bowl, and their dish soap

>  Just take their car. Massive inconvenience. Worth more money than the other shit mentioned

>  Lip chap in the winter

>  Their family photos. 

Because it’s the one thing  you can’t replace.

>  All Spatulas.

>  All the soap.

>  I would slightly unscrew things so they make noises and look crooked.

>  All the TP

>  Take their can opener. It'll be super lame when they need it but can't find it.

>  The bolts/screws that hold a shelf up. What’s a shelf on the ground gonna do?

>  Stealing their tv remotes would make their lives living hell

>  Their toothbrush, now they just have to buy a new one.

>  The can opener. Probably not something they’d go looking for every day, but when you need it, it’s pretty frustrating to not be able to find it because there’s not really a good (safe) alternative for the job.

>  A screw from the dryer so it shakes and makes loud noises.

>  I would pull all of the blinds up and cut the draw strings

>  The batteries in their alarm clock, so when there’s a power outage their alarm doesn’t go off on time

>  Chargers, pins, extensions, and utensils.

>  Teabags

>  TV remotes. I new a kid in College that would always steal remotes from parties. One of the biggest d-bag moves ever.

>  The pots for Plants, a shit ton of dirt all over the floor and furniture.

>  I think somebody stole my remote.

>  Photo albums, because you can't replace those.

>  I’d pull the little piece of rubber out of the power button on their TV remote. Still technically usable but a pain in the ass

>  The lightbulbs in infrequently used places (e.g. a utility closet). I’d take them from places that you go in just often enough to be like “oh shit, I need to change this light bulb”but promptly forget as soon as you walk away, followed by getting progressively more annoyed every time you realise you still haven’t replaced it.

>  Steal a pillowcase every 3 months. They won't even notice until it's time to change their pillowcase and even then it's going to take them a good bit of time.

>  It'd have to be something that's not easy to replace. Batteries, forks, etc, you can just go and buy all those items for a few bucks. 

I'd steal the little rubber feet that you find on the bottom of things like laptops, keyboards, and countertop appliances. Those fuckers are impossible to find and the expensive item isn't worth replacing just because of the inconvenience. 

Oh wait, I already do that. 

"Yea, remember that church camp you made me go to when I was eight? Have fun with mixmaster now bitch!"

>  A pipe so they need to go to Home Depot to buy a new one.

>  Napkins, rubber bands, plastic silverware, paper plates

>  The plastic cup you pour the washing detergent into and put it into the machine.

>  Second to top stair.

>  Easy, all ya gotta do is steal every light bulb from the house, including the ones in fixtures as well as flashlights. Bonus points for replacing all of the extras with your favorite color.

>  All of there bed covers and towels because it’s cold as fuck where I live and I’ll take anything that keeps me warm

>  I swear to god, someone is stealing my gingerbread. Either I started eating in my sleep, or something is seriously wrong. I'm kinda scared to be honest.

>  Pillow case covers, and while I'm at it untuck their bed sheets.

>  Family heirlooms

>  Just enough socks and underwear so they never have enough for a full week

>  Steal their pillows.
All couch and chair cushions. 
Leave nothing but a singular, really thin pillow for the beds.

They will come home, sit down and say, 'hey bill pass me a cushion' but there will be none for them. Eventually they buy more pillows. Steal them too.

Steal their pillows
Steal their comfort
GAIN THEIR COMFORT

>  Just one doorknob

>  All the teaspoons.

Want to make a cup of tea or coffee and want sugar? well good luck using regular spoons and knowing how much!

>  One battery from each remote.
All the charger cords except for the old old old ones from a decade ago that only work with the brick style Nokia.
I'd replace all the Elvis records with Ylvis records.

>  I'll take their life. It won't bother them a lot, but its an inconvenience

>  Unscrew their all the lightbulbs so they don't  light up but are still there, when they go to change out the bulbs they would have a new one but realize that the one thats there was just in the socket loosely.

>  Steal all their utensils

>  Cut the cords from things like microwaves and such

>  Nail clippers and hair brushes

>  Anything you'd pack to stay overnight somewhere. I'm talking toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, socks, underwear, deodorant, bath towels, Combs, hairdryer, makeup brushes, Etc.

>  Don't steal anything, just break everything so minorly it will slowly drive them insane.

>  About 2 or 3 left socks. Just enough to make it noticeable on laundry day

>  The dog.

>  Someone broke into my car recently.  Instead of stealing anything of value, they took my USB chargers and all those "store program" point cards.  

That included my casino cards so the next day when I sent to a casino I had to get mine reprinted.

>  Their toiletpaper, soap and dishsoap, towels and washing cloths

>  The twist ties used to keep the bread bag closed.

>  All their laundry detergent and/or their bath sponges

>  All but -1 the eggs needed for a recipe. So if you need 3 eggs, I will leave 2.

>  The Circuit Breaker.

>  Just turn off the breakers for the outlets where they charge their phones. As long as there's no lamps or appliances plugged in it could be a while and many chargers/cords before they think to check the outlet.

>  Cutting out only the faces of the children in the family photos

>  I steal all their measuring cups.

>  As many screws as I can possibly get away with taking out of everything around the house. Starting with the outlet covers.

>  I would take the doorknobs to all the bathrooms.

>  I'm not even stealing, I'm just dripping little bits of toothpaste into their sink, so they have to scrub away something designed to scrub away, which is easily the most annoying shit there is.

>  The cover to the remote controller. So the batteries either fall out or you have to use annoying tape.

>  Someone stole the plastic strip off the edge of my drivers side car door, revealing some metal interior. Now my car static shocks my hand one out of every tens times I close it.

>  Their porch

>  Toilet seat, and empty out the hand-wash soap and leave just a little so they can't get the soap on their hands

>  Nail clippers. I’d come back periodically and steal their replacements. Then I’d hit them a third time and return all of them. 
  
Rinse and repeat.

>  All the doorknobs. No more privacy and all the doors are just swinging open.

Plus I hate doorknobs for many reasons.

>  Toothbrush, shampoo and body wash.

>  Their power for 1 minute every day at the same time so all their clocks reset.

>  Their fabric softening sheets or softener

>  The TV remote. When they get a new one I will walk past their house every night and start changing the channel

>  I'd take the paddle from their mixer...they wont even notice until they try to use ther mixer.

>  Spoons, but only ones typically used for eating.

>  Batteries. Even the ones that are already inside stuff. All of em.

>  Clock, pillow covers, iron(the thing you use to straighten the finished laundry) and pens.

>  Shoelaces. Belts. Toothbrushes. Deodorants. Brushes. Pens. Pencils.

>  I‘m going to cut open the paddings of their chairs in a way that nobody notices afterwards. Then I’ll only take out so much of whatever is making them comfortable that they become slightly uncomfortable but nobody notices a big enough difference to question anything.

>  switch out the toilet paper for the really bad break in your hands kind of toilet paper

>  10 mm socket

>  Cut the top half of their toothbrush so only one row of bristles remain.

>  I would steal 0.01 percent of their milk until they don't have enough to eat their cereal.

>  I wouldn't steal anything. I would find a way to turn all their plugs upside down, or the other way so that they have to plug in their things the other way and it might make the cord have to bend in a weird-ass way.

>  First item TV remote.  No one would ever think that was stolen. They will look for it for hours.

>  Shoelaces and I would replace regular keys with ones that wouldn't work

>  Soap. One witness account claimed and I quote: “He stole ma soap. Who steals soap?” 

(never actually stole his soap, but I couldn’t help but put that “he stole ma soap” vine in here)

>  The bristles off ALL of their brushes (no matter what type it is)

Might switch them round some days

>  Shoelaces. I want all the shoelaces and anything that looks like a shoelace.

>  All the batteries I can get my grubby hands on.

>  I would take between 10mm-20mm off random chair legs in their house.

>  The remote of their tv, so they'll look everywhere but they'll never find it. They will probably point fingers to each other of whom they think lost it and it'll probably end in complete chaos, ruining the trust of the family.

>  Hasn't this been posted before like last month

>  I look forward to seeing the best one of these shared by you as a personal story on r/pettyrevenge

>  Their family members ashes

>  Goodbye toilet paper! Don't even bother looking for the tissues. Those paper towels on the wrack? Gone. Your last resort will be your hand. And hey, the soap is right there... unless...

>  All the TP

>  Socks. But not all of them, no no. I'll steal an odd number of sucks slowly over the course of several weeks. Soon enough that brand new pack you bought that had 22 pairs is now down to 1 pair, and one loner.

>  Tooth brush.

>  Their light bulbs, imagine going to the toilet in the middle of the night without lights on everything

>  The measuring cups/spoons...😏

>  I think it was Discovery channel used to have a show where a former thief was hired to break into people's homes so they got kind of a wake up call, then they outfitted them with security systems and stuff.

The guy said he rarely took TVs, too bulky and not worth much used. But he always took the remotes, just to be a dick.

>  All the clocks in the house

>  Their plug sockets

>  hahahaha i laughed this is a bad kink.

>  I would steal their lightbulbs. Then unscrew all the lamps slightly so they have to go to the store to replace them.

>  I’d break in everyday (because I have that kind of free time) and never steal anything, just move things around/hide them. Those car keys you left on the hook by the front door? They’re under your mattress. Have fun being late to work.

>  Take random screws out of stuff

>  Their cooking oil

>  All their doorknobs

>  10mm and 36mm sockets and wrenches

>  Just break in occasionally and turn all the toilet paper under instead of over, or over instead of under if they are already wrong.

>  Garbage bags, laundry detergent, phone chargers

>  Just steal rich people's food. You get to give the food to the poor and the rich people just have to go buy more food. It's a win-win scenario.

>  their tea bags, coffee, milk & sugar.

>  Hmm prolly the butter knives or hand soap, gotta use steak knives and bodywash haha

>  Washing up liquid or dishwasher tablets, and do the same when they buy a new one

>  Easy, I steal a tile or plank of wood off someone's floor. Just imagine seeing a random tile gone from your kitchen floor lol

>  Someone got into my car a couple weeks ago and only stole my phone charger. Lol I'll say that because I was pissed I had to go buy another one for like 5 bucks.

>  Toilet paper, but just leaving enough so that the guy runs out in the middle of the act:)

P.S.- indian here, so no problem if the same happens to me

>  Their family

>  The bath salts.

Wait till they have a bad day and want to relax by taking a bath and BAMM I ruined your bath.

>  A screw from the TV Wall Mount that they're about to install. They're going to be searching for that thing for hours and trying to figure out if one screw will do.

>   In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it.

>  I would steal their soap.

>  All the toiletpaper, and the bicycle-saddle.

>  Pasta tongs. From every house I can. Most people only have pasta occasionally so they won't even notice until right before they need to serve their pasta. BOOM! FAMILY argument over were whoever put the pasta tongs.

>  I wouldn't necessarily steal anything, but I feel like if I unplugged the wifi router that would be just as annoying

>  A family photo or a photo album.

>  All the spare keys, never use them and never take the originals, only spares, for all time

>  One or two doorknobs

>  one Battery from the remotes. Also going to put already dead batteries into their fire alarms, and I'm stealing all but one plate/spoon/fork/knife/bowl/glass. And while I'm in there I'm shutting off their heater/ac, and taking ever ounce of milk and eggs in their fridge.

>  The first week all the spoons, than replace the spoons and take all the forks the second week.

>  Miscellaneous kitchen utensils. You never realize how useful a good spatula or spoon is until it's lost or destroyed.

>  Fingernail clippers. They'll go to clip their nails, give a concerted search effort for a bit, forget, then go at it again in the next few days.

>  The milk from their cereals

>  I’d steal their water meter and replace it with just a pipe. Then I’d go home, install it where my meter is and turn all the faucets on for a few hours. Then they would be confused why they have a $500 water bill and then hire a plumber(me) to find the leak. I’d then “fix” their problem. Wait a month then do it again. All the meanwhile I’m getting free water and this poor sucker is footing the bill while paying me money. 

Gotta go for the long con.

>  All the pens I can find. I’m not convinced this hasn’t happened to me.

>  Milk. I'd pour out bowls of cereal before I leave too.

>  Im stealing all their shoes and sandals, and when they buy more im stealing those so they run out of money and return them when they go bankrupt

>  Half the bristles on each tooth brush.

>  Extension cords

>  All blankets, just image they have to sleep with a bad feeling... Only the problem is... They cannot sleep!

>  The plastic forks they only use like twice a year, so when they go to use them they realize they don’t have them for whatever reasons which causes them to look where they could be, then just have to use metal forks instead.

>  Nail clippers, as someone who cringes at the thought of long nails.

>  The toilet paper in public restrooms, but only the bottom roll, so they have to wrangle TP out of the upper roll around the holder because that thing that makes the roll fall down into place never works.

>  All the batteries, but only when someone needs them.

>  Backs of earrings - Kevin Hart

Antique family photos because it’s the one thing you can’t replace - John Mulaney

>  All of the detergent, whether it’s for the dishwasher or the washing machine.

>  Their front porch, if they hav one. Hav fun lunging up through ur doorway.

>  All the hand soap and toothbrushes in the house and replace them with icy hot and steel brushes

>  All the batteries except for one set so they have to be exchanged every time you want to use a certain item

>  I’m stealing your toothpaste and throwing your tooth brush in your toilet

>  Toilet bowl brush

>  Pry all nails from floors, cuboards, shelves even from the walls and then glue everything back.
Imagine you need to reposition the mirror or a painting and it comes with the plaster... (i can hear my wife screaming "What the f*ck did you do?!")

>  All their laundry detergent ohh or their shower curtain

>  All the soap.

>  Take all of their left shoes so not only will their right foot will be in pain but also they'll have to wear two different colored shoes

>  Their car. If it's insured like it should be they just go get another one.

>  There bannister but only from people who have had it for a long time

>  Steal the TV remotes, I did this at college parties. Family photos are good too, because they are the only things that can't be replaced.

>  Slight or not, the hand will be chopped.

>  belts

>  My husband’s ex took the dividers from the silverware drawer. Pure evil.

>  Id just steal one small thing that connects stuff together... except all of that one thing, ie the little key chain loop, or maybe their shoelaces. Their gonna be so pissed off that i could probably hear them from a mile away.

>  I like that Dane Cook bit where he breaks into a place. And steals nothing to drive the family crazy.

>  their children because then they will have to file a report but at least they won’t have to deal with them after that

>  The thing that pulls storm doors closed.

>  Lightbulbs from their home's light fixtures

>  Their toliet flappers inside the water tank so water would continue to run and I would also use two part epoxy on water shut off valves

>  The hands of a clock

>  their dogs leash

>  Corkscrews.

>  Your remote controls...

You see, when I was a kid in the early 80’s, someone broke into our house, stole a bunch of things (including my mom’s wedding ring) and...
...The remote control to our new TV.  

(yes, they did leave the TV).
The only reasoning we could think of was that TV remote controls were still kind of new at this point (this one wasn’t even infrared, it emitted sound you couldn’t hear) and the thief probably thought it was a calculator or something.

>  I steal 3/4ths of their cutlery and plates.

>  All of their deodorants. I furiously hate it when I've run out of deodorant and I have to go out with bare armpits :')

>  All of their extension cords and outlet splitters. Watch your days disappear as you plug and unplug everything you own!

>  Your memory of what you were going into that room for. I'm going to steal it just as you get to the room.

>  As someone whose house was broken into a few years ago, their wallet. 

All I lost in the end was the $40ish in cash in there, but I had to cancel all my cards, dispute charges, go to the DMV for a new driver's license, update all of my autopay bills, and so many other shitty, stupid errands. I'm still annoyed!

>  Toothpicks and floss so they have to use their fingers to pick stuff out of their teeth.

>  Drain plugs and toilet plungers. Don't use them often, probably won't initially notice them missing, but when you need it, you need it.

>  I would take a little piece of material from the toe of each sock. Just enough that they'd realize there's a hole in it after they've already walked around in them. So then as the day goes on eventually your big toe makes it's way through the sock. Just one sock from each pair will have a hole in it. If you're like me this has happened to you and it is infuriating.

>  I would steal all clocks and, and set every alarm to go off at a random time.

>  There bread and butter

>  All of their doorknobs

>  Doorknob

>  All of the replacement rolls of toilet paper. So the ones in the hallway closet, the ones under the sink, etc.

By the time they notice, I'm long gone

>  All the light bulbs in the house. The air from one of the tires on their car. The blade from their lawn mower. All their laundry detergent (but leave the bottles, filled with tap water).

>  All of the replacement rolls of toilet paper. So the ones in the hallway closet, the ones under the sink, etc.

By the time they notice, I'm long gone

>  Their tooth brushes

>  Their chargers and their money so they can't buy new ones

>  The spare rolls of toilet paper people keep in the bathroom. 

Next thing you know, you’re shitting and you’re out of options...

>  The same thing I’ve always stolen, one sock, every time you do laundry. :)

>  Steal all the toilet paper except on for one roll, this way when they completely run out they will have buy more.

>  All their utensils

>  Sink faucet rings. The ones that prevent water from spraying your pants when you're trying to wash your hands.

>  One holiday lightbulb per strand.

>  Enough of their batteries that they have to keep switching what they put them in.

>  Their toothbrush. They'll have to either go through their days with bad smelling breath or spend the extra dollar or two on a new one.

>  The sound from only one earbud

>  Their aluminum foil and parchment paper, any seldom used spices that are useful for certain dishes like coriander and turmeric.

>  Man all of these things are so evil because they’re the type of thing that would piss me off so much every time I had to deal with it (left sole of my shoes missing for example) BUT I would never solve the issue and replace what was missing.  So ironically, it might cause more suffering than if someone took something of value.

Up until not long ago, my family had a broken drawer for months, which we used everyday.  It took like five minutes to get it out, and like five minutes to get it back into a good enough position.  Yet it took so long for my dad to get the right piece of hardware to fix it because it’s not the type of thing that you can really prioritize

>  All of the brand specific plugs to TV's, computers, coffee makers... Everything that you have to order for half the price for the full item.

>  I would sneak into every persons house, and take the snooze button off all alarm clocks. Imagine a world of no snoozing...

>  The soap on the bathroom sink

>  All their hangers.... Even if they're in use....

>  Bed sheets

>  I'd take all their chargers and USB plugs and replace them with broken ones that you need to bend a certain way to make them work

>  I’d just move everything in their house 1-3 inches to the right, just enough for them to trip over everything, but not enough to know what’s going on

>  I guess a lot of people have already written toilet paper... Maybe I would steal every candle and flashlight, then turn off the electricity when they are home.  
Edit: I also got this idea:  
The lightbulb form the basement and a plank from the stairs leading into the basement.

>  I would do the bastard’s taxes. In a few years, the IRS will audit the shit outta him!

>  Nothing. I’m going to the house of the guy who made a 33 by 33 Rubik’s cube and mixing it up.

>  All their eating utensils -- that'd be pretty frustrating.

>  all their doorknobs

>  All the batteries in the house. Some small batterys or expensive but just cheap enough

>  I’d steal all lamp shades. Because as it turns out, bare bulbs are pretty bad sources of light.

>  Their soap

>  Milk and eggs. Along with their good phone charger so they think they lost it somewhere.

>  Instead of stealing things, I rearrange their house. Want some cereal? Good luck finding it, let alone a bowl. Need to replace a toilet paper roll? Not on my watch, and definitely not on yours, as it's gone the way of your wife, who thought you were crazy. Your life has become Peter Parker in Infinity War, and now it ends on a low note.

>  The minute hands on every clock.

>  The Table/teaspoons, and the measuring spoons.

>  Why steal? Just switch up the labels of food cans.

 Soup? Now it's fucking peas!

>  Someone hacked my mom's Netflix account, deleted her viewing history, and never watched a single show.

>  First I’d start with taking 2 pennies a day. After 5 days of doing that I start taking 5 pennies each. After 10 days of doing that I’d move their table by 2 cm and take a bit of soil from their plants. After 20 days of doing that, I do it all over again.

>  The first thing that came to my mind is toilet paper.

>  Their TP.

>  All of their batteries and leave a lava lamp do that for 10 years.

>  Only steal blunt wraps

>  Agree. My GF doesn't have one of those, in her home they all shower while holding the shower head with one hand.

So uncivilized.

EDIT: I swear showering in that house is the thing I hate the most.

I even had to come up with a thing to trap the shower head between two of the shower screens so I don't actually die of hypothermia while trying to wash my hair. A couple of times my life hack fell off and I made a mess in the bathroom but I'm willing to risk it.

>  Their Girlfriend 😔

>  Swith the lightbulbs with expired one and put a pack of expired lightbulbs where they could see them

>  One of their set of four plates.

>  All the oven mitts.  The tray where you put your muddy shoes.  Wet wipes- by the way all you men's men of the world who've never used wet wipes as an adult, you're missing out.  I used to be one of you, I've seen the error of my ways.  Don't be afraid of your feminine side.  Sorry off topic...

>  Hygiene products

>  When I was an obnoxious 13 year old about two decades ago, some friends and I were trick-or-treating on Halloween night. We knocked on a door and noticed it was slightly open. It sounded like people were in the backyard but we couldn't hear anyone inside. Indignant that someone had abandoned their candy post, we stepped into the foyer to get grab our own handful from the bowl provided. Then we proceeded to grab the TV remote sitting on the table next to the candy and quickly slip out. Those poor bastards probably lost their minds looking for that remote. I still feel a mix of guilt and shame with a dash of amusement.

>  Their coffeemaker. Have fun being grumpy without your morning coffee within your standard morning routine of having coffee at home!

>  All of their spoons except for like one or 2. It's annoying having to re wash the same exact soon every time you need one. I say this cause we have suspicions that someone has done that to us or we have a spoon stealing ghost.

>  The spatulas

>  I'd shave down one of their middle stairs about a half inch. That way when they go down their stairs they always stumble on one, or going up they stub their toe.

>  Their combs and brushes. Unkempt hair for everybody!

>  All of the outlets. But I'd replace them with those fake outlet safes that you can use to hide valuables in and put a gift certificate for a hardware store in a different city in each one for exactly the value of one outlet.

>  You have to play it smart - things that no one will immediately notice but will inconvenience them the moment they need it.

A battery out of a wireless mouse or remote, the dust pans, the cords for kitchen appliances, one wheel off a chair, toilet paper, empty the soap bottles and put the bottles back, any trash bags, some forks and spoons so they only have a full set of knives from their kitchen sets, the Ethernet cords but only some so a few devices still work fine,if they have a book of computer passwords grab that, if you know a holiday like Christmas is coming take half of the canned cranberry sauce, put the other half back in the cupboard behind everything, just so you can take their hopes as well.

Do it over time, slowly, they'll go nuts.

>  All their pants and under wear, can never go out in society again

>  A blanket, a pillow, and some candles

>  I would steal there tooth brush and stock there bathroom with toothpaste and a toaster because who likes regular bread

>  Say goodbye to all your cups

>  The carpet.

>  One shoe. All the forks. And - hat tip to Jon Mulaney's pal - family photos.

>  their windows so when it rains they might get wet

>  I would steel their shower curtains. They would notice very quickly but they would have to shower before they got an opportunity to buy more shower curtains.

>  My housemate got drunk one night and stole two of my exs house number things

>  Every chapstick they own. Each time they buy a new one at the store, it disappears within 24 hours. No moisturized lips on my watch

>  I would take all of their toilet paper minus just a little bit off the rolls on the wall so it looks like enough to take a shit but then they go to do so and they're only left with like one square and run out when the time comes.

>  Wait are you making Untitled Goose Game 2?

>  All their utility tools like screwdriver or hammers.

>  The fuses in half of their light switches, so the think the bulbs burnt out. Only half so the don't assume it's an electrical problem right away.

Plot Twist: When they go to buy new bulbs I replace the fuses and take the other half I skipped in round one.


Double Cross: The family Cat was in on it the whole time.

>  Antique photos, because it’s the one thing you can’t replace

>  The toilet 
I like to see them struggle

>  Take the fuses from the circuit breaker

>  Steal their milk and bread, nothing more annoying than waking up to realising you don't have anything to eat for breakfast

>  I go around stealing all their light switches but leave the screws

>  The plunger. You never notice it till you need it, and when you need it, you REALLY need it.

>  Fingernail clippers

>  The Rubber O-ring helping keep your shower head sealed on correctly so there isn't water spraying out of the threads when you turn it on. Not going to ruin lives but it will ruin your shower experience

>  Spare inhalers, a minor inconvenience, until...

>  Their anime body pillows...all of them...

>  I wouldn’t steal anything but I’d hide their essential belongings in different places each morning so it’s always a hassle to leave the house on time making their commute to work/school just that more annoying ( ex: keys, wallet, phone, glasses etc)

>  Fridge water filter and the light that says it need to be replaced

>  underwear

>  Toilet seat. Some poor guy is going to try to sit down and then fall in.

>  TP

>  i wouldn't steal, i would just smear my poop over their walls... haha epic

>  All of their old family photos. They can never replace them and probably wouldn’t notice right away

>  I’d take the one thing they can’t replace.

>  Fingernail clippers. They will look for them for a long time before they buy another pair and it will drive them crazy.

>  Pillows that way they have trouble sleeping and have to buy more and they can’t silence they’re bed while doing the “dirty”

>  One screwdriver from the matching set of five.

>  A toe nail clipper. You're never going to really need it, but when you get a hangnail it's my time to shine. }:‑)

>  The blower from your HVAC unit.  My ex-husband did that to my house before I could move in.

>  I would wait until they go on holiday and then spend the whole time removing their floor and replacing it with the fluffy stuff in the loft.

>  All the spatulas. So random and impossible.

>  Tooth brush

>  Shoes, CLEAN cooking utensils (knives, forks, spoons, etc), and laundry baskets. 
Also, just for fun I'll hide their keys.

>  I would go down though this as I Rob them and do everything...lokelyeading the entire family to insanity.

>  Their boats, most value not really an inconvenience

>  All their chairs - Have fun sitting on the floor!

>  All of their spoons.  Or if I'm feeling like a real dick and want to inconvenience them with a dash of irony, all of their knives.

>  I once stole candy from a convenient store when I was ten I was like “they are going to find out and I’ll be in so much trouble and everyone will probably not trust me” turns out they never found out and even if they did I don’t think they would care it was a pack of nerds

>  I steal the car keys of the guy who lives within 200m of his workplace and return them before he comes back home.

>  Spatula

>  Most of their TP...leave just enough on the roll to get them started...

>  I would say chargers... But I have like 400000 of them.

>  The whole toilet, try taking a shit now Karen.

>  Replace all the alcohol with water! Want them to stay hydrated!

>  Their door mats, have fun with dirty carpet fools

>  Stealing 80% of their bread, so they constantly are left with just a few slices ~and the end pieces~

>  There bed(s)

>  Bedsheets...the fitted ones. If I were careful enough, the one they are sleeping on goes as well

>  Steal their electric tooth brush and replace with a manual one.

>  Coffee grounds. It’ll show who’s REALLY dedicated to their line of work

>  I was a shitty teenager, and I used to watch “it takes a  theif” so I got a lot of ideas from them.
 
Take a single shoe from a pair near the door, steal the batteries out of the remotes, put the bookmark in the wrong section of the book. 

It’s the little things.

>  I would change all of their default search engines to Bing.

>  Their laundry detergent.

>  I'd steal the screws from the chairs so when they sit down they're in for a ride. I could also steal the potato peeler so they would have to use regular butter knives, because i stole the sharp ones aswell.
I'd place a cocumber on the bed for fun.

>  I'm taking the toilets. No more thirty minute Reddit shit breaks.

>  5/6ths of their gasoline.

>  The elastic in their socks.

>  Either the toilet, the refrigerator, washer and dryer, dish washer, or the entire pantry. Not just the food the whole pantry.

>  All of their toilet paper, and hang handtowles where the tp goes

>  Their keys, to everyday steal one random item when they sleep

>  The battery covers to all their devices. Every time you move/pick something up you have to cover it with your hand quick enough so the batteries don't fall out. Extra annoying for things that "reset" when the batteries are taken out.

>  I have one that actually happened to me. 

Someone stole the slats from the chair that was sitting on my porch. They stole them one at a time too.

>  The spoons. Try eating cereal with a fork, you can still do it but it’s just not the same.

>  Spatulas.

>  You cannot steal something without stealing something my friend

>  Replace all of their most commonly worn clothing by exact replicas 1 size smaller until everything is extremely too small (or just shrink their clothes). 

The key is to do it slowly and keep the tags the same so they question their whole reality by the end when their shoes don't fit anymore and they have to bundle up to go outside, only to find belly-shirts and a child's coat.

>  Random pieces of clothing they laid out for the next day, maybe not completely stealing some. Just like, moving it somewhere else in their home. Rinse and repeat and I become the clothes napping ghost that they tell their kids about. Till the same happens to their kids, and they panic. They call a close family friend to come to keep watch, The close friend can’t come so they send their older kid. I’m the older kid, they don’t know it, now I know exactly what they’ve done to adapt. Instead of laying their clothes out they put them more organized in their drawers. Perfect, with inside access say I left something in there room. I switch all their outfits while they go out to dinner. I call the neighbor and they switch places with me while I tell their kids that he did it. They come home to the neighbor and find out their clothes are scrambled, the neighbor says it was me but their kids say otherwise. The neighbor gets charged and I get to see them everyday in wacky misplaced outfits on rush days. Eventually I tell them it was me but they ignore me, the news comes on and an accident at a nearby college comes up and they learn the news. They frantically try to lay out their clothes in hopes they will be misplaced. But alas, nothing ever comes up. Their kids much older now made a memorial, for me, the clothes napping ghost, who actually became a ghost.

>  Every left sock. Theyll never know they were even stolen, theyll only blame themselves

They cant even go outside and get more socks without being uncomfortable at some descent level

>  Waffle irons. They won’t notice until they randomly decide they want a waffle one morning... then, bam. They can’t have one.

>  Their bathroom shoes/flippers so they enter the wet bathroom floor barefoot

>  Can I picke more than one? Because I'd go with one of each sock. They turned up missing for me recently, so i'm actually speaking from personal experience that this is INCREDIBLY irritating.

>  Steal their lighter if it’s a smokers home.

>  Half of their socks. Never again shall their feet possess a matching set of socks.

>  You're all missing the most obvious and annoying one, steal all their garage door openers. 

Every time they want to park their car in the garage they're going to have to go through the front of the house to open the garage, and every time they leave they'll either have to have someone else close it for you, or you have to time it right, press the button and run/jump past the sensor before the garage door closes.

>  Break off all the ring pulls to the tin cans/can drinks without opening them. Plus then shake up all the fizzy ones.

>  Razors and shampoo. Not conditioner but all shampoo. They won’t notice until they need it most. Then they will run around the house wet looking for it hopelessly.

>  A few socks, their extra batteries, their measuring cups, their stapler, their scissors, and their chairs. Mwahahahaha

>  Wow this post applies to me and I have something relevant to share!! This goes back to when I was in high school about 5 or 6 years ago.  Back then a lot of people still had land line phones so a friend of mine who I went to house parties with a lot used to steal the handset for the land line.  He also stole TV remotes fairly often.  Totally an asshole move but it 100% would cause a slight inconvenience for the homeowners who so generously opened their home to a bunch of drunk teenagers.

An odd number of socks. If they have different colored pairs, then one per pair.

Their extra trash bin liners.

All the eggs from their fridge (but leave the carton).

Their laundry quarters, if applicable.

Half the lightbulbs

The butter
A lot of socks
Shoe strings
All but one toothbrush 
The tops of the soda bottles.
I would then slightly unplug everything and place a paper clip in the tank of the toilet reservoir so that it's always running. Hell let's just got ahead and open the tops slightly of anything carbonated and take anything maliciously organized and unorganized it. And subtract 7 minutes from every clock.

>  Their acetone! 

I love painting my nails , and I do it often. I also like customizing dolls, and need pure acetone to remove the factory paint. Stealing my acetone would be annoying since I use it so much, but I could just go out and buy another bottle for 98 cents.

>  I'd steal the part of the vacuum cleaner that creates the suction.

>  all the hair ties and rubber bands. also 25% of their bowls.

>  Keep stealing all the new batteries they buy, replace them with ones that are almost dead.  Let the non-sensible anger rage as they press each button on the TV remote 10 times before anything happens and it never gets resolved.

>  I steal nothing tangible, just home owner’s time and sanity by switching their cabinets’ contents around. Maybe one time I just put their most used pantry items in the back and the very old ones in the front so they have to look for them. Or maybe reverse the direction of the organization of their silverware drawer. If I really wanna screw with em I’ll switch where they store their cups and mugs with where they keep their plates and bowls. They’ll be opening the wrong cabinet for a bit until they relearn where it is or move it back.

>  I’ve threatened people for years that I would “find out where they lived and steal all your bedsheets.” Sometimes I say batteries instead

>  Small things. Key rings, hiding socks and leaving no matches, a roll of tp, salt or pepper shakers, other utensils so they clean more often. A lot of things can make their life cleaner but worse.

>  I would totally steal the that little basket that you put all your cutlery in to wash in your dish washer. The thought of having to see people wash them by hand, knowing it would annoy them with each finicky item.

>  TP!!!!

>  Homework. Steal it,wait till they're at school, put it back.

>  There are no "slightly inconvenient" things when what you've actually stolen as a burglar is their sense of safety and security in their own home. It doesn't matter if all you took was a hand towel.

>  all their forks. they either never eat spaghetti until they get new ones, or try and eat it with spoons/knives. then ill go back and do it again when they get more.

>  All the had soap

>  Tampons, plasters and cotton buds

>  This will get buried, but the spring part of all their nail clippers.  They'll still close, but without the tension needed to cut the actual nail.

>  Remote controls for TVs

However, in place of the remote control I leave a much more expensive item. For instance, I steal a remote but leave them a 70" flat screen tv, which I then steal the remote from. It's so diabolical because then they have to drive and spend time to get a remote so they can use their tv. That's at least 20 maybe 30 minutes out of their life. It'll ruin them.

>  Utensils. All of them.

>  All there dishes

>  All measuring items in the house. Measuring cups, spoons, bowls. They won’t know till they know.

>  In London centuries ago, street thieves snatched fashionable handkerchiefs.  They got prison for one, and 'Transported' for a second offence.

>  A girl I know stole all of this douchey guys tv remotes at a party before leaving.

>  All the spatulas. Try flipping eggs with a slotted spoon.

>  The spark plugs out of your old gas lawn mower that requires you to yank on the pull cord to start it. You nevah gonna get it started, but your arm will get the mutha of workouts!

>  Their light bulbs.  You don't even have to steal them.  Just unscrew them a bit.

>  The utensil rack from their dishwasher

>  one sock from random pairs.  Been traveling the world doing it for years.   Never been caught.

>  Take their bananas

>  All of their toothbrushes, floss, etc. Super cheap and easy to find and not an emergency. You can live with not brushing your hair and teeth in the morning but picking everything you need up on your way home.

>  one singular sock each time i come to his house

>  I'm stealing all of the bowls and plates so that they will have to use the nice china and risk breaking it

>  Girlfriend

>  A bite of their animal style double double leaving no pickles left.

>  Computer mouse if they have one. Lots of stuff can still be done via keyboard if you know how.

Also maybe take a few choice buttons of their remote control like their volume up button and the channel down button. Oh and the pause button too.

>  Just steal all the damn sheets in the house

>  I would eat all of there boxed snacks, but leave the containers. That way they think they have cookies or crackers, but right when they've decided to eat it, it's gone.

EDIT: Clarification

>  I steal their OCD by making everything crooked

>  Coincidence I think not

>  I would take the salt and sugar containers, then either mix both or take the salt one and fill it with sugar so they don't have any salt
Probably would do it to someone I don't like so I can get a sweet revenge

>  All of their doorknobs

>  I'd continously steal every hygiene product they own. I'm talking toothbrush, toilet paper, floss, menstrual pads, towels and every other thing under the rainboe but one by one and if they buy new stuff I steal it again.

>  Extension. Cords.

>  Shovel during a snow storm

>  Hair brush. While I’m at if I’ll rearrange their bowls, plates and silverware

>  Toilet paper and light bulbs  because first of all they would have to hold it until the  bulbs replaced and the after the poor poor he/she would have to ether run to get more at a store or wipe with socks ps make sure you grab the paper towels too

>  This actually happened to my parents in 2002. They stole all the remotes. 

Story behind this: we had to get out of our rental but technically didnt have the A-okay to move into our house my parents were building. We stayed in a hotel for 2 weeks while they were finishing up but we put all of our stuff in the new house garage. For some reason my parents put all the remotes together. Someone broke into the garage and stole our big screen tv (one of the huge box ones) and then they took all of the remotes. It was the most annoying thing as universal remotes sucks

>  Only steal toothpaste, make them go and buy it everyday

>  If this happens at night I'd just steal their phones, set their time on a entirely different timezone and make random alarms. But if I were to steal something I'd probably steal a few towels and every night steal one of each type of clothing (underwear, shirt etc)

>  I would replace sugar and salt. And watch them from the fake bushes (that i brought with me) take first sip of coffee in the morning.

>  (If they use them) All of their Keurig Cups

>  The new soap bars, but not the old small ones.

>  Their baking sheets, good luck making pizza rolls without them bad boys

>  the good pot/pan that everyone uses so they need to use the shitty old one

>  Doorknobs

>  Dog leashes. Going to the vet? Not today. Pooch mid vomit? Too bad, fuck your carpet. Pup needs a piss? There goes your favorite chair. And god forbid it’s time for Fido’s dump, because you were never going to wear those running shoes anyway.

Similarly, spare cat litter or maybe just the scooper.

>  Well you cant wake up with a cup of coffee when you dont have any sort of cups to drink it in!

>  Their virginity, I'm a straight guy, so this inconvenience will last 8 months-18 years

>  I would slightly unscrew all the lightbulbs so that they still work then just need screwing in.

>  The left hand turn signal from their car and only the left hand turn signal fron their car.

>  The toothbrush. Because when they notice, it's probably a bad time to go out and find another one.

Bonus points if I find a toothbrush used to clean stuff but not for brushing teeth. I'll just put that one where I stole the other one

>  All the toilet paper in their bathroom besides a questionable amount left on the spool. Just enough to convince them that they can make it work but upon further inspection and commitment they find their rations depleted and life decisions questionable.

>  I'd break in, put on a little show,  and hopefully steal a few smiles before the cops show up.

>  The little tray in the washing machine you put the detergent and fabric softener in

>  Their beds

>  Cotton Swabs

>  Their carpet or linoleum floor. If they have both, then just  their carpet.

>  Those little rubber feet from the underside of the toilet seat so it makes a loud clank when you put it down

>  Doorknobs

>  One sock from each set. The tv remotes. All the cellphone chargers. Half the light bulbs in the house. All the laundry detergent. 

If there's more than one person living in the house this would cause chaos. Everyone would be blaming the other for missing chargers, looking endlessly for remotes, and a matching pair of socks. 😈

>  I wouldn’t steal anything I would just break in. It will haunt them for years, they would wonder every day what went missing and it would torture them for the rest of their lives

>  They call me the Toilet Paper Bandit. They will never know I was there until it's too late

It’s the one thing you can’t replace

>  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

>  I would take all the utensils

>  One time I chained my bike outside a grocery store and came back to find they had only taken the seat off. Such a pain in the ass!

>  I would steal all their paper (blank so they can't print anything if they need to), the shampoo and hair conditioner, and also steal their certificates for GSCE's and A level's (British qualifications) so if they need to apply to a new job, good luck! Also to be pure evil, I's hide their keys in the sugar bins, random drawers and some too in the rubbish bins. AND put all their sugar and rubbish in the master bedroom! Muhawawawaw!!!

>  Their hand soap and the spare ones

>  I know I'm late, but one time my car got broken into. The person who broke in took everything out of the glove box and center console, and just put it in the back seat. They took everything that was on the floor in the back and put it on the floor in the front, and everything that was on the back seat and put it in the front seats. Nothing was missing at all. It was all just very intentionally moved around.

>  Clean underwear.

>  My dignity, oh wait that’s already stolen

>  I would steal all their right foot socks 

yes people there is a sock for each foot and since most people would put on the right foot first. It's almost not noticable.

>  1. I steal all of their light sources probably just light bulbs so they have to buy enough light bulbs for the whole house

2. I squat in their house and steal all their toilet paper constantly so they have to remember to buy toilet paper but then they forget by the end of the day being forced to use scratchy paper towel for their poop crevices

>  I would steal all clocks and, and set every alarm to go off at a random time. >:)

>  I'll steal the toilets so that they'll shit in holes the rest of their sad, bonerless lives

>  Phone chargers, or really chargers of any kind. At first they’ll think that they’ve just misplaced them, and then they will begin to use their devices less and less up until all of them are under five percent battery and the owner is crying out to god to get him to bless them with another charged. Believe me, it’s happened before.

>  All their utensils

>  Cotton swabs or anything else they use to clean their ears with. Have fun with earwax buildup on your earphones!

>  All the Tp, papertowels and facial tissues.

>  This has been asked before lmao

>  all of the songs on their playlist so they’ll have to go and find them without knowing their names.

Context: my toaster broke about a month ago and it took a week until we got a new one, and in that time I realized that you use a toaster much more than you think you do.

>  This thread just reminds me of when my apartment was robbed when I had just started my career after college.  Along with all my electronics, they took my dress socks and underwear.  The cops were convinced I knew the person and they had a grudge lol

>  This question

>  i'd steal nothing but family photos of deceased relatives

>  Peanut butter.

>  I'll steal every battery in the house, and then remove all the batteries from all the TV remotes. Instead of taking the remotes as well, I'll just hide them in really inconvenient spots. Like in between the couch cushions or something like that. 

That way, when the family looks for the remotes and FINALLY finds them, it'll have no batteries. And then when they leave to go grab batteries, they'll be dissapointed once again. "Maybe I can take the batteries out from the other remote." Haha, you stupid bitch.

>  If it is a teenager with depression, i will steal everything because they don't already care about life.

>  Taking a note from the people who got me a few years ago - The TV remotes.

>  i'd steal nothing but family photos of deceased relatives

>  Their phones. No wait, that would highly inconvenience them.

>  I’m stealing all their remotes. Gotta get up to do everything now!

>  All the hygiene items and blankets

>  Their blankets, but leave the bed sheets. They won't make it through the night

>  Remote control. Have them believe it’s just stuck between couch cushions or someone’s sitting on top of it

>  Just all the toilet paper on the roll..so they have to go under the sink and put another one on.

>  Tooth brushes or emergency floss: the kind you keep in hand bags and such.
No more minty fresh criss cross double floss for you

If I could have chosen remotes, I would have, but someone else already took it

>  Their underwear

>  I don't want to take anything but I just want to rearrange every decorative item I can find. Haunting baby pictures in bathrooms. Wedding photos in the laundry room. Elegant soap dishes in living rooms. Desk lamps in sinks. Delicate figurines on stairs. And curtains on the wrong windows that don't fit.

>  The lightbulbs in all the bathrooms. 


This one time the light in the bathroom went out and it was like that for a few days. Those were the most annoying few days ever.

>  soap

>  In my first week at uni, my flatmates broke into the other student accommodation buildings and took the sheets off their beds and dumped them in their sinks.
They then went round chanting "Where's your bed sheets" all night.
Classic

>  I would take every goddamn sock in the domicile. Oh yeah, double down. After they are replaced, (thanks Walmart) i come out of hiding in their basement and do it all over again!                                                                             So as not to seem prickish, only the very best of my candle light suppers would be awaiting their daily return from their ever present toil. Vacuuming, windows, the works! All inclusive like.                                      My discovery, I’m sure, would be hella awkward. But, alas! My superior cooking skills would finally be discovered. The sparkling kitchen and bathroom fixtures would not be denied!                                                      I’m sure we’d all be the fastest of friends. I could teach them of the long lost art of Oingo Boingo,chicken foot and salt carving. The future is ours!

>  Employee ID. Where I work it is relatively easy to get a new one, but until it arrives you need to be picked up at the lobby every morning

>  all the good pillows and leave them with the really thin ones.

>  I wouldn't steal anything. Just move lots of things to places still in the house.

>  I'd just move everything and leave a mess to give the impression that they got robbed. But don't actually steal anything. They'll be so confused and wondering what on Earth is missing.

>  Toilet bowl covers

>  All of the bread except for the heels of the bread. You could tear a family apart with bread-based drama.

"Steal" all but the last dregs of milk & creamer (just less than what you'd need for a cup of coffee or even a decent small glass of milk on its own).

Soap & TP. Laundry detergent & dryer sheets too. 

Batteries from remotes & USB cables or the base plug for phone chargers.

>  How about TV or any kind of Remotes. This would be super fun because every time you pass their house you can switch the tv channel or stuff.

>  Batteries. Both in use and packaged. Nobody ever knows they even have the packaged ones, and they're gonna think a family member took the ones in use.

>  I would steal everything that tells time.

>  All their circuit breakers and the label from the circuit panel.

>  The first thing that came to mind was their underwear. I’m not a creep, it was the thing tang would most inconvenience me. You’d think nothing is missing and then you would get ready for bed or the next day and discover the horror.

>  All the spices in their pantry. Imagine knowing you had all the ingredients to make a recipe and you start cooking. You go for the cumin and BAM! no cumin! It sucks to have to stop in the middle of a recipe to go get the proper spices you need!

>  All the saucepans and all of the cooking utensils

>  Id set all of their clocks an hour back and take the bulb out of their fridge.

>  All the draw 4 cards out of their uno pack so no one can get hurt again

>  I had the aux cord stolen out of my car about 8 years ago. Very inconvenient. Didn't have Bluetooth yet. It was the only thing stolen. I know it was stolen because I saw the footprints too and from my car in the dew.

>  Their spare batteries so they think everything is fine until the remote dies and they have no other option but to run to the store.

>  All their tampons and pads/feminine products the first day of their week and everyday when they buy new ones.

>  The spinning water things from the dishwasher. They’ll send it round three times before realising

>  Phone charger. They can buy a new one very easily, but that's gonna be a pain in the ass to deal with for a couple of hours.

>  Phone charger, left AirPod, (only the left one) toilet paper, one random food product, and the blankets off their bed.

>  I steal name signs off the doors of Professors that treat the class like shit. I hope that when they come in and realize it’s taken they have to think about it for 5 minutes and have that slight inconvenience of letting someone know they need a new one, and that in that 5 minutes they can consider why it was them out of anyone who had their sign stolen.

>  Steal one shoe from every pair of shoes. I'd even buy new pairs of the same shoe in different sizes to replace that individual shoe with just to increase inconvenience.

>  All working writing utensils.

>  The strings that draw the blinds up and down.

>  Toilet paper, tooth brushes, milk, coffee

>  All of the milk. Put them into bags but only keep a few drops, won't be enough for cereal now.

>  Take shoelaces off of every shoe and cut the plastic tabs off the end of the strings.

>  I wouldn't steal anything, I'd just go inside and move every piece of furniture like 5-10 inches to the left. It wouldn't be noticeable, but they'd probably stub their toes on everything. Then to top it all off, I'd put a lego that's the same color as their carpet in every carpeted room.

>  All of their belts

>  The sugar bowl/container.

>  All the spoons, go a week without a spoon...

>  Their soap

>  Shower gel, but not the shampoo, so they have to use the shampoo to wash their whole body.

>  All the writing utensils. Everything they can use to write. Have fun doing paper/homework.

>  The pop sockets from their phones.

Be forced to watch YouTube videos on your phone at an awkward angle, you peasants.

>  I'd go and steal all of the socks in an entire neighborhood during wintertime. Everyone has to go either bare-foot or without socks into shoes, and go out to work, school or whatever. No-one will believe them when they tell their coworkers: 'Yeah so I stepped out of bed this morning, put on my clothes, and what do you think? My socks were gone! Yes, all of 'em! Yes, also the ones in my closet, on the drying rack and in the washing machine!'

And in the mean time, I'll be laughing, in my cozy home.

With warm feet.

>  I wouldnt steal "all" of one thing or the other. But I would take like, their second to last beer. Just so now they have to go to the store

Also gonna pour the last bowl of cereal and milk, eat that, and toss all those dishes  in the sink. Don't worry I left all the regular ingredients around the kitchen. But now you gotta cook dinner and do some dishes, bitch.

>  Can openers. Hands down, most frustrating thing to be without when you need it.

>  Steal all their paper/plastic utensils, plates, and cups so they will have to to the dishes.

>  I don't steal anything-I just toss shit around to make it look like somebody went through all of their stuff.  So, when they get home, they'll freak the fuck out and spend hours checking to see what was stolen.  It's a huge inconvience for everyone, and they're gonna spend the next five years of their life wondering what the fuck the burglar took.

>  Phase 1: Collect Underpants.

Last option is I leave an item to confuse the shit outta them. So now they have 2 sofas instead of just 1.

>  the insole from one shoe, and i’ll replace the other one with a slightly smaller shoe.

>  I've actually have had this happen a few years ago.. they took my unopened mouthwash. :(

>  the insoles of their shoes

>  Dish washing soap and toilet paper. Greasy dishes and rags are awful.

>  Single sock from washing machine... Is this a hypothetical question or do you need some tips?

>  I would steal all of the utensils and only leave 1 of each

>  Soap.

>  All the soap, dish washing liquid, and sponges in the entire house

>  Doorknob

>  I think I saw already but imagine every day you go to take a shower and have NO soap/shampoo... maybe as a thief you wait until they are already in the shower before stealing to be a real pain in the ass and inconvenience.

>  If I could do it often I would deplete things periodically 
ice cubes, toilet paper and paper towel rolls, milk, sugar, eggs, etc. coffee, razors,  etc.

>  Soap.

>  The good spatula

>  All the spoons in the house. How fucking pissed would you be making a bowl of cereal with no spoon?

>  Egg

>  I steal something small. They can tell something's wrong, but not what. Or I switch the m and n keys.

>  All of the band aids besides one of the ginormous ones and one of the super tiny ones. That way, they don't have one of the right size.

>  Tv or Roku remote, oh the agony of an endless search for something that doesn’t reside in your house anymore haha.

>  Potted porch plants

>  Either doorknobs or the little piece of plush fabric under chair legs so they’re hella loud

>  The clock

>  Old family photos.. the one thing you can't replace

>  I wouldnt steal anything, I would first throw a party you know, to basically destroy everything, the I would move everything in the house to left 1 foot, then I would break the washing machine and dryer, and dump water on all their clothes (especially the socks lol).

>  Almost all of the toilet paper. But like enough for one go. But not enough for two. So you have to get another roll.

>  I’d steal the doorknobs so they couldn’t get into their House

>  
All of the plates, bowls and cups but leave the utensils.

>  WHERE ARE ALL THE DAMN LAMP SHADES?!?!

>  Soap, shampoo, conditioner, toilet paper, etc. Basically anything important from the bathroom.

>  I'm taking their corkscrew. They won't notice until it's too late.

>  Every other stair. Plus unscrew all the door handles a bit as you leave

>  Underwear.

>  Their credit cards. In a day and age where cancelling the cards and getting the replacements mailed to you can be done with a phone call, it's really an inconvenience these days as opposed to a genuine concern. But boy would it be annoying not having them available for the next week.

>  Their scissors. I need em more

>  All their TP...

>  I steal that one sock that always go missing from your laundry.

>  I’d cut out the crotch of all of their underwear.

>  Just enough toothpaste to where they can still get some but they really need to squeeze

>  The key to their front door.

Then once they've gone to the trouble of having the locks changed, I'd do it again.

>  Toilet paper.


After that it would be small, petty shit. Stuff like door stops, ceiling fan rope switches. 

One of the most inconvenient things in my house is the fact that the builder put the light switch on the wrong side of my door. So every day I have to swing the door open, enter in the dark, shut the door and then turn the light on.

It seems small at first but it becomes very annoying. But that's not stealing and would take some work.

>  Take the shampoo out of their showers so they'll be in the shower and then won't realize till it's too late

>  All of their toilet paper, their chargers, the soap and shampoo, all tooth brushes and their under-wear.

>  Take only their big cups, leave them to suffer with kiddie cups

>  All their underwear and pants, except I’d leave the skirts...

>  All their TP

>  Their DS stylus they wont know if they lost it  either.

>  The oil or gas from their car.

>  Probably something they wouldn’t notice, like their left kidney.

>  The quarters they have saved for laundry day

>  Definitely all of the socks that fit your feet. You will be left with the slightly too small socks, that when you put your shoes on they ever so slightly fall of the heel of your foot

>  Tooth brush, deodorant, and any remotes I can find. 😈

>  Doorknobs

>  personal identification documents. I had someone steal my wallet, then throw it away without stealing nothing but my fucking ID. Why?

>  I'd steal all their charging cables and replace them with shorter ones.

Or id steal a few random utensils from their drawers so they start doubting how many they have or what utensils they actually had

>  One of the blind strings, all lamp shades or light covers, middle door hinge, toilet stopper.

>  The same question again

>  The plastic tie that comes with sliced bread. Although instead of slightly inconvenience I'd say that 50% of the population wouldn't care and just knot it and the other half you'd just ruin their fucking lives.

>  The doorknobs to every bathroom and closet.

>  All the clock's in the house!

>  I rob someone for ONLY their profits. They may keep enough to continue their business, but I get any profits they had on hand

>  Either all of their bread or shampoo.

>  Set the clocks all forward twenty minutes so they show up early everywhere until they figure it out. That’s right, I robbed your time.

>  Yesterday I went to a person who had their HDMI cable stolen.

>  Their heart for scientific reasons of course :) and their sadness

>  Doorknobs. Just doorknobs.

>  All power strips, so now every time you try and charge something you have to unplug another.

>  all of their cups

>  Finally, my time to shine. I'm taking all the knobs on the stove, cabinets and all drawers in the house. I'm taking random breakers out of their breaker box. Door knobs and toilet flushing handles. Batteries out of all remotes and controller chargers. Also, I'm taking their shower curtains. 

My friends and I came up with this elaborate plan while we were in the navy just trying to pass time and we've tried it on each other many times. Whoever we did it too was severely frustrated and angry but it was well worth all the formal grievances and headaches because we never snitched on each other and they never got their stuff back.

>  The insoles on their shoes

>  Nail clippers, all their floss, all their shampoo and soap, all except one spoon and I'll magnetise it to make it taste like garbage, and then I'll loosen all the doorknobs enough to work but they're Shakey, and then steal all the screwdrivers except the one that's slightly too small to work.

>  Coffee creamer and spices from the spice rack. Sucker, you gotta go to the store on the way home from work.

>  Once I stole the calculator cover from some wannabe bully's backpack...and slipped it back onto the calculator in his backpack at the end of the school year.  Hope that was a small mindfuck.

>  Their #10 wrenched and sockets.

>  Their tooth brush

>  Tv remote batteries. Not all of the toilet paper, but just leaving enough to make it hard to use. I’d drink a lot of the milk to make it difficult to eat a bowl of cereal with.

>  Like the tiny demons that exist in the world, all the tiny things you drop at random intervals- that you car you remember having yesterday- missing, that bolt you’re trying to find but gave up yesterday? Missing. Your pencil that you didn’t care about till now? Missing. Etc.

>  Steal an inch off of the 2 front legs on all their chairs so they slowly slide off and only realize it till their all the way down.

>  Hair elastics

>  I'd unscrew everything and take the screws.

>  Okay, so 6 months ago my friends place got broken into and the person stole his tv, ps4, some expensive fishing gear, a few other typical household items but also took a gallon of 2% milk he had just purchased. 

He complained soooooo much about the milk being taken. Like legit didn't seem to care about the other stuff but was livid someone took his gallon of milk.

>  besides clocks and chargers I think toothpaste would do the trick.

>  Their tooth floss.

I would personally go insane looking for it, I can't go to bed without flossing my teeth.

>  So basically, what would you do if you were a goose?  :)

>  The power cord to their wifi. You know, the brand specific ones that are a pain in the ass to replace...

>  Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants hey!
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum tay.

>  tooth brushes

>  Their teeth

>  Their nail clippers. At first it will be alright, but after a while everyone gets long fingernails but no one is willing to go to the store for one thing.

>  One airpod

>  The toilet handle to lift the plunger. They can still wipe, they can still flush, but flushing will be a pain in the ass.

>  The second ply of their 2-ply toilet paper

>  The ads that come up on their YouTube video watch time.

>  Doorknobs

>  Family photos. It's the one thing you can't replace.

>  I had an ex girl girlfriend who, soon breaking up with me, moved all of her stuff out of the apartment. She was pissed so she was a dick about it. The biggest pain in the ass was that she took every ounce of soap in that place. Dish, shower, hand, any and every kind of soap. That was annoying. Ha!

>  The little ring on the tub or switch that turns the bath into a shower... no more showers.

>  I break into a billionaires house and steal absolutely everything.

>  All their pencils. You don’t realize how important they are at home until you need ‘em.

>  I would steal someone's videogame password, then play it just a bit. I would wait til they were near a level up, then I would level them up. When it's time to distribute points, I will mess up their character build just a tiny bit. Not enough for them to notice right away. I would also make their character just slightly uglier every time I did this. Not enough to notice right away. I would also steal pens. Just one at a time. I would also use their pencils. NOT steal the pencils tho, just use them a bit. Enough for them to have a general feeling that someone used their pencil a bit. I will use the pencil on my crazy thief person's notebook to document when I stole which pen, how I did it, and when the next pen victim will be. I will also keep and use the pens in front of the victim, and when they insist that I stole their pen I will make an elaborate story of how I bought it and when. The days I 'buy' these pens will directly correllate with the date that the pen went missing. I will also in my crazy person notebook document how much that pen is actually worth on that specific date and where it can be bought (it will be written with said pen, of course) You know. So I have an alibi. Once the pen has done it's job through the ritual, I will 'accidenally' leave it in a public place that the person convenients a lot. Like a gas station, bank, etc. That way I will slowly induct others into my secret pen stealing cult. I gotta go, my next victim awaits.

>  It's not the inconvenience, it's the offense,  you took things, so yes, STILL STEALING!

>  Their time in the most unamusing way

>  All the tooth brushes

>  Toiletpaper

>  All the command strips, shower curtain rings, and double A batteries in the neighborhood, inclusive ng the hardware store

>  Their nail clippers, have fun searching for those.

>  Old photos—the one thing that’s irreplaceable

>  Lightbulbs out of every socket , all the shoes and underwear

>  Idk about you guys, but I’m stealing one lightbulb from a whole chandelier. That way, every time they look up at it, they will see that ONE BULB MISSING. 😈🤣

>  The 10mm socket.

>  I’d cut off all the blinds pull cords.

>  Ther "" key from ther key board. Mne s already mssng because same happened to me on aprl first, twenty nnteen

>  Food (milk, bread, cereal, ect.), so they constantly have to go down to the store to stock up on small shit all the time.

>  Well, purely based on the questions sentence structure; their sanity via gas-lighted nicknacks.

>  The lamp covers. It wouldnt be worth all the effort to replace them and would just annoy them for the rest of time.

>  Old antique photos, because it’s the one thing you can’t replace

>  Steal just one floorboard or tile from the floor of every room

>  I'd loosen the screws on anything I could find, then take of half of the toilet paper, you know how you can separate the halves of the tp? I'd take half of it, leaving shitty little thin floofs of toilet paper.

>  I would have to say all the toilet paper because no one would ever expect it.

>  The food they were gonna eat the next day

>  Hypothetically (never would commit burglary in my life): Warm hats, gas cap, umbrella, phone charger, and debit/credit cards...

>  A few years ago someone broke into my apartment and stole my remote control to my TV.  I moved from that apartment into a duplex and a year or two went by. I came home from work and the old missing remote was on top of my pillow... 

Pretty sure it was my dad making sure I didn't get too content at any point in my life.

>  That one big fluffy blanket. Say goodbye to a cozy winter

>  Doorknobs.  All of them.

>  Take all of their utensils and replace them all with plastic sporks.

>  Each and every writing utensil. You'd never really notice until you had to write something. Then search everywhere in the house for it and go to the store to buy more. Bonus points if you steal them and repackage them to sell the pencils or whatever right back to them for profit.

>  The plastic cover for their cake.

>  I'd wait for them to have a brand new loaf of bread and then take the little plastic thing that holds the bag closed.

>  Their blankets on their beds, leaving only the bedsheet.

>  Hi, my names Bernie Sanders and I need your help to win this upcoming election.

>  Oooh or all the lighters/matches in the house. Doesn’t come up often (if you’re not a smoker anyways) but man is it annoying trying to start a campfire or light a candle when you can’t find the friggen lighter.

>  I'd replace all of their plates with paper plated and cups with paper cups etc. I might even replace their cutlery with sporks and only sporks

>  Half of each pair of socks. At least then there'll be a reason for them to be missing other than just sheer speculation.

>  I would steal all there spoons one by one so then eventually i would get all of them but it will keep getting slightly inconvenient.

>  I steal the peels from their bananas. Or the skin of any fruit they have on the counter. Have fun with fruit flies.

>  If it's a family of four I'll steal all but 3 forks

>  Bathroom doorknob

>  Eating utensils

>  soap

>  There for nail clipping left on the floor 😍

>  Every writing utensil in the house

>  Steal a sock from their washing machine

>  Cut all the tips off of the chargers, leave each roll of tp with one square, take the turntable out of the microwave.

Then go to the car and lower the tire pressure just enough to trip the light.

>  The TV remote of course! But that's an obvious one and there's SO many ways to mess with people's heads. 
Their alarm clock. Toothpaste.  Plug for the tub. Take off their house key off the ring. One of their favorite slippers. Reading glasses. The mat you wipe your shoes on. The little container that women put their jewelry in when they wash their dishes. The charger for their phone or iPad. Favorite coffee mug. I know that one would make me crazy! I could go on but you get the point.

>  Steal nothing. Be like the guy that popped my rear windshield on Black Friday while I was working 9am-9pm and ran away when my alarm went off. Now I’m holding a $2700 estimate for repair and my insurance says they’ll only cover $500.

>  hmm...their nail clipper, so they won’t be able to clip their hangnails and instead they’ll have to peel it off in the old-fashioned, inefficient, painful way.

>  Whatever it is that keeps the toilet seat up while a guy has to use the restroom. So he’s forced to hold it up himself.

>  The best looking thing in the fridge that I can tell the person had been waiting to get home to eat. Maybe the handles to their sink

>  Their bandages and plasters. People really stock up once a year so that cut is going to be real bitch for longer than usual.

>  Find a specific color towel in their house, one that they only have one of. They'll spend atleast a few days wondering where the hell it is

>  I'd steal the trash. And tidy everything up. Put things away. They'll be dumbfounded.

>  A piece of their floor board

>  One of the screws that goes into the seat of the toilet.

>  All of their doorknobs

>  A pornstar's homemade videos

>  The tp holder rod

>  their time.

>  I would steal a dork and then leave a different door that is slightly off.

>  Their sanity.. no one needs that nowadays.

>  The kitchen tools you rarely use. Peeler, garlic press, can opener etc. They won’t notice and will be constantly saying “ I’m sure we had one.”

>  The carpet

>  the missing “s” in your question.

>  Batteries, i could swear i bought some some weeks ago

>  Shoelaces. You never realize how much you need them until they're gone

>  Shampoo.  Because you get in the shower and realise you don’t have any, then you always forget to buy it

>  Bathroom cleaner

>  Their bed sheets

>  All I can think of is Dan Cook's B&E. I'll just move the home owner's shit around and steal their remote batteries.

>  Their watch

>  I steal a kitchen object, like a knife, greater, spoon mixer, etc. Something that isn't to important. And I just watch as they suffer for not having their item.

>  I would take all of their belts, half of their socks,

all but one teaspoon, every single clock.

I would take their phone chargers, wifi passwords, tupperware lids.

I would take all their doors, so everyone could see what I did.

Every placemat, their slippers, and every dryer sheet.

I would browse their DVR, on every show I would hit delete.

I would take their plunger, their washcloths, and all their bars of soap.

But that's all I would take, at least that's what they would hope.

Chairs untucked, a couch slightly askew, the position of their beds would be changed.

You can be sure all their furniture would have been ever so slightly rearranged!

I wouldn't dare touch their computer though, in fact I wouldn't even log them out of reddit.

I would even leave them one gilded post, from their name of course so they could reap the karma credit.

I'd have stolen their internet identity, since they'd have to delete their account with dismay.

Because there on the front page, their salacious browser history would be completely on display.

>  Tooth brush. No one checks until they brush their teeth in the morning or night.

>  I cut off all the plugs on the cords so nothing can be bulged in. I take them with me.

>  The batteries out of your dildo

The light in the refrigerator

Laundry soap. You better go back to the store if you want clean clothes for work tomorrow

All of the regular size forks. Only teeny size and jumbo size forks left.

Handles on the dresser

And I'm also rearranging your furniture as you sleep. When you wake up in the middle of the night to pee you'll stub your toe

I will also move your nightstand 1/4" at a time every single day

>  My victims favourite spatula. They’ll never be able to replace it, and they’ll always feel that loss.

>  All the electric tooth brush chargers

>  soap

>  All of their milk so they can't have cereal in the morning.

>  Steal someone's outfit. I would find a victim who just got a new outfit. Then I would hire a group of people to wear the same outfit, bonus points if they are beautiful. Then find where the person is going and have a person be planted in that location and wearing the same outfit. Even better if another actor is there and gives the planted outfit stealer compliments on their outfit. Then the actor sees the victim and says something like 'oh, I see you're taking fashion advice from this person here. Haha' then when the person goes to another store or something have another person in the same outfit. Everyone will be wearing hidden cameras and wired with bluetooth headsets as well. The more unique and hard to find the outfit, the better.

>  A fucking tub of mayonnaise

>  One of the keyboard stands from the back of the board, so it is always at the wrong angle

>  All the extension cords

>  All their pens and or pencils! Oh wait do people still use those?

>  Tp

>  Taking nothing, but show my presence. This is how you take away someone’s security. It happened to me. I’m still wondering why someone would come into my house and not take anything. They used the bathroom, got something to drink, and took nothing. They left a stale cigarette smell in the bathroom, and anytime I get a whiff of it when I’m out and about, it brings back the same unsettled feeling.

>  Their cups.

&#x200B;

have fun drinking soda out a saucer.

>  Just enough milk from their gallon that they can’t put as much milk as they’d like in their cereal, without it being completely gone

>  All their cutlery and toilet paper. You don't know how much you need them until they're gone.

>  I wouldn’t steal I would cut their phone charger so when they wake up they feel like “ well my days ruined now “... it’s the small things

>  Old family photos

>  I’d steal the lights that perfectly go around the Christmas tree. So that way they have to use 2 sets of light or just have one set that’s too short.

>  Leftovers

>  Their regular cups. Or am I the only one who gets anxiety from drinking water out of a coffee mug?

>  I would first time out my victim’s routine and find the perfect time to strike. I would wait all the time in the world for my victim to sit down for a shit the steal and the toilet paper in the room/house

>  Had a burglar only steal our TV remote a few years back. Most likely someone just checking doors, and stealing stuff at random. Anyway, we have the same TV now, but with a shitty fake remote. I had to change channels with the buttons on the back for months, because I didn't bother to get a new one. Both the shittiest and most annoying break-in.

>  Just the cutlery, dishes, and cups.

>  Doorknobs

>  Under the cover of night, i slip into people's home's and silently steal SHOELACES! MUAHAHAHAHAHA

>  I would steel all but three pairs of socks and underwear. They will have to either wear dirty socks and underwear or do laundry all the time or something truly horrible, go to the store and buy more.

If I was feeling particularly evil I would replace all of the stolen socks and underwear with duplicates that were three or four sizes smaller.

>  One time at a party I was having, someone stole the power cord to my router that was very inconvenient.

>  it says slighty inconvenience, you people are all devils

ahem, id steal all the power cables

>  I'd stole every battery that could be put in their tv remote, and they wouldn't buy a pack of them for months. I experienced it first hand.

>  I wouldn’t steal anything, just swap the sugar and salt

>  I would steal their coffee beans but replace them with decaf

>  Not steal.  Just hide all the toilet paper rolls in the attic.  Then one day when they pack house to move they find 15 years worth of TP in one location.

>  I’m taking every tv remote, No one will be left unblamed the family will cave and fall apart from the lack of trust “No you had it last” “Stand up I bet you’re sitting on it”

>  Five of spades.

>  I'd steal the milk, so no coffee or cereal

>  When I was a cop in about 2005, I worked a burglary where everything valuable had been taken from the home of a middle-aged couple that went on a cruise. I took the report and told then if anything else they discovered missing needed to be added to the property section. A week later I got a call saying the film camera they reported missing had been discovered under the bed. Another week after that, I got a frantic call from them. I went to their house and they developed the film.. regular photos until about half. Way through, and then a photo of a big black ass that had the bristle ends of toothbrushes inserted. It was the couples' tooth brushes. That they had been using since they returned. I guess they would rather have had their toothbrushes stolen.

>  It would be very difficult to only slightly inconvenience people if you burgle their homes. If you secretly steal stuff that they will notice missing then you might have them questing their memory of it, and you'd essentially be gaslighting them.

If you make it obvious that you've stolen it then you'd hugely upset people by violating their home.

You'd have to steal things that people find useful but don't know for sure that they own until they want to use it.

Or steal from workplaces with lots of people rather than homes.

>  [deleted]

>  Steal all the circuit boards out of all electrical devices xD

>  I’m gonna steal their receipts so they can’t refund things they brought

>  Car Keys, Phone charger, Microwave plate, spoons, one sock, the list could go on ;-;Edit sorry i thought of more: taking color ink from printers, taking ur beer caps so it goes flat, taking all ur tp, paper towers etc, lids to those huge metal cups

>  Did u rob pewds?

>  Their Dog's Collar. 
Our Dogs Usually Have Theirs Off Until They Are Going On A Walk. 
I'd like to see their Dog's faces when they need a walk.

>  Their toilet paper. Whatcha gonna use now Samantha? That’s right nothing.

>  I am not a burglar, I am a victim. When you steal you are also stealing their fucking sense of security. Their previously unacknowledged unrecognized right to be inviolate. Fuck you, and fuck your hoodlum friends. Your question reeks of entitlement, perhaps you are posting in the wrong thread?

So I'd steal the fuse out of the plug for some sort of appliance which is used _fairly_ regularly but not every day. Maybe the vacuum cleaner?

How long do you think it would take someone to work that one out when it doesn't turn on? Then, if they took the appliance somewhere to try and have it repaired, imagine the "you fucking idiot" look the person in the shop would give them when they found the problem.
